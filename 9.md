# Chapter 9: High Memory Management

* The kernel can only directly address memory for which it has set up a page
  table entry. In the common case, the user/kernel address space split of
  3GiB/1GiB implies that, at best, only 896MiB of memory may be directly
  accessed at any given time on a 32-bit machine (see 4.1)

* On 64-bit hardware this is not an issue as there are vast amounts of virtual
  address space, however 32-bit is another story.

* On 32-bit hardware Linux temporarily maps pages from high memory into the
  lower page tables (discussed further in 9.2.)

* In I/O operations, not all devices are able to address high memory or even all
  the memory available to the CPU (consider [PAE][pae].) Asking the device to
  write to memory will fail at best and fuck the kernel at worst. To work around
  this issue we can use a 'bounce buffer' which is discussed in 9.5.
