# Chapter 4: Process Address Space

* One of the major advantages of virtual memory is that each process has its own
  virtual address space, mapped to physical memory by the operating system.

* This chapter explores the address space as seen by a process, and how it is
  managed by linux.

* The kernel treats the userspace portion of the address space very differently
  from the kernel portion. For example, allocations for the kernel are satisfied
  immediately and are visible globally, no matter which process is current.

* An exception to this however is [vmalloc()][vmalloc] (and consequently
  [__vmalloc()][__vmalloc]), as it causes a minor page fault to occur to
  synchronise the process page tables with the reference page tables, however
  the page will still be allocated immediately upon request.

* For a process, space is simply reserved in the linear address space by
  pointing a page table entry to a read-only globally visible page filled with
  zeros.

* When the process tries to write to this table a page fault is triggered
  causing the kernel to allocate a new zeroed page and assign it to the PTE and
  mark it writeable. It's zeroed so it appears precisely the same as the global
  zero-filled page.

* The userspace portion of virtual memory is not trusted nor presumed
  constant. After each context switch, the userspace portion of the linear
  address space can change except when a 'Lazy TLB' switch is used (discussed in
  4.3.)

* As a result, the kernel has to be configured to catch all exceptions and
  address errors raised from userspace (discussed in 4.5.)

## 4.1 Linear Address Space

* From a user perspective, the address space is a flat, linear address
  space. The kernel's view is rather different - the address space is split
  between userspace which potentially changes on context switch and the kernel
  address space which remains constant.

* The split is determined by the value of [PAGE_OFFSET][PAGE_OFFSET] (==
  [__PAGE_OFFSET][__PAGE_OFFSET]) - 0xc0000000 on i386 - meaning that 3GiB is
  available for the process to use while the remaining 1GiB is always mapped by
  the kernel.

* Diagramatically the kernel address space looks as follows:

```

```

* To load the kernel image, 8MiB (the amount of memory addressed by two PGDs) is
  reserved at `PAGE_OFFSET`. The kernel image is placed in this reserved space
  during kernel page table initialisation as discussed in 3.6.1.

* Somewhere shortly after the image, the [mem_map][mem_map] for UMA
  architectures (as discussed in chapter 2) is stored. The location is usually at
  the 16MiB mark to avoid using `ZONE_DMA`, but not always.

* For NUMA architectures, portions of the virtual `mem_map` will be scattered
  throughout this region and where they are actually located is architecture
  dependent.

* The region between `PAGE_OFFSET` and `VMALLOC_START - VMALLOC_OFFSET`, is the
  'physical memory map' and the size of the region depends on the amount of
  available physical RAM.

* Between the physical memory map and the vmalloc address space there is a gap
  `VMALLOC_OFFSET` in size (8MiB on i386) used to guard against out-of-bound
  errors.

* As an example, an i386 system with 32MiB of RAM with have `VMALLOC_START`
  located at `PAGE_OFFSET + 0x02000000 + 0x00800000` (i.e. `PAGE_OFFSET` +
  32MiB + 8MiB.)

* In low-memory systems, the remaining amount of the virtual address space,
  minus a 2 page gap, is used by [vmalloc()][vmalloc] for representing
  non-contiguous memory allocations in a contiguous virtual address space.

* In high-memory systems, the `vmalloc` area extends as far as `PKMAP_BASE`
  minus the two-page gap, and two extra regions are introduced - kmap and fixed
  virtual address mappings.

* The `kmap` region, which begins at [PKMAP_BASE][PKMAP_BASE], is reserved for
  the mapping of high memory pages into low memory via [kmap()][kmap] (and
  subsequently [__kmap()][__kmap].) We'll go into this in more detail in chapter
  9.

* The fixed virtual address mapping region, which begins at
  [FIXADDR_START][FIXADDR_START] and ends at [FIXADDR_TOP][FIXADDR_TOP], is used
  by subsystems that need to know the virtual address of a mapping at compile
  time, e.g. [APIC][apic] mappings.

* On i386, `FIXADDR_TOP` is statically defined to be `0xffffe000`, which is one
  page prior to the end of the virtual address space. The size of this region is
  calculated at compile time via [__FIXADDR_SIZE][__FIXADDR_SIZE] and used to
  index back from `FIXADDR_TOP` to give the start of the region,
  `FIXADDR_START`.

* The region required for [vmalloc()][vmalloc], [kmap()][kmap] and the fixed
virtual address mappings is what limits the size of `ZONE_NORMAL`.

* As the running kernel requires these functions, a region of at least
  [VMALLOC_RESERVE][VMALLOC_RESERVE] (which is aliased to
  [__VMALLOC_RESERVE][__VMALLOC_RESERVE]) is reserved at the top of the address
  space.

* `VMALLOC_RESERVE` is architecture-dependent, but on i386 it's defined as
  128MiB. This explains why `ZONE_NORMAL` is generally considered to be only
  896MiB in size - it's the 1GiB of the upper portion of the linear address
  space minus the minimum 128MiB that is reserved for the vmalloc region.

### 4.2 Managing the Address Space

* The address space that is usable by a process is managed by a high level
  [mm_struct][mm_struct].

* Each address space consists of a a number of page-aligned regions of memory
  that are in use.

* They never overlap, and represent a set of addresses which contain pages that
  are related to each other in protection and purpose.

* The regions are represented by a [struct vm_area_struct][vm_area_struct]:

```c
/*
 * This struct defines a memory VMM memory area. There is one of these
 * per VM-area/task.  A VM area is any part of the process virtual memory
 * space that has a special rule for the page-fault handlers (ie a shared
 * library, the executable area etc).
 */
struct vm_area_struct {
        struct mm_struct * vm_mm;       /* The address space we belong to. */
        unsigned long vm_start;         /* Our start address within vm_mm. */
        unsigned long vm_end;           /* The first byte after our end address
                                           within vm_mm. */

        /* linked list of VM areas per task, sorted by address */
        struct vm_area_struct *vm_next;

        pgprot_t vm_page_prot;          /* Access permissions of this VMA. */
        unsigned long vm_flags;         /* Flags, listed below. */

        rb_node_t vm_rb;

        /*
         * For areas with an address space and backing store,
         * one of the address_space->i_mmap{,shared} lists,
         * for shm areas, the list of attaches, otherwise unused.
         */
        struct vm_area_struct *vm_next_share;
        struct vm_area_struct **vm_pprev_share;

        /* Function pointers to deal with this struct. */
        struct vm_operations_struct * vm_ops;

        /* Information about our backing store: */
        unsigned long vm_pgoff;         /* Offset (within vm_file) in PAGE_SIZE
                                           units, *not* PAGE_CACHE_SIZE */
        struct file * vm_file;          /* File we map to (can be NULL). */
        unsigned long vm_raend;         /* XXX: put full readahead info here. */
        void * vm_private_data;         /* was vm_pte (shared mem) */
};
```

* A region might represent the process help for use with `malloc()`, a memory
  mapped file such as a shared library or some `mmap()`-ed memory.

* The pages for the region might be active and resident, paged out or even yet
  to be allocated.

* If a region is backed by a file its `vm_file` field will be set. By traversing
  `vm_file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping`, the associated `address_space` for
  the region may be obtained. The `address_space` has all the
  filesystem-specific information needed to perform page-based operations on
  disk.

* The relationship between different address space-related structures
represented diagrammatically:

* There are a number of system calls that affect address space and regions:

1. [fork()][fork] - Creates a new process with a new address space. All the
   pages are marked [Copy-On-Write (COW)][cow] and are shared between the two
   processes until a page fault occurs. Once a write-fault occurs a copy is made
   of the COW page for the faulting process. This is sometimes referred to as
   'breaking a COW page' or a 'COW break'.

2. [clone()][clone] - Similar to `fork()`, however allows context to be shared
   with its parent if the `CLONE_VM` flag is set - this is how linux implements
   threading.

3. [mmap()][mmap] - Creates a new region within the process linear address
   space.

4. [mremap()][mremap] - Remaps or resizes a region of memory. If the virtual
   address space is not available for mapping, the region may be moved, unless
   forbidden by the caller.

5. [munmap()][munmap] - Destroys part or all of a region. If the region being
   unmapped is in the middle of an existing region, the existing region is split
   into two separate regions.

6. [shmat()][shmat] - Attaches a shared memory segment to a process address
   space.

7. [shmdt()][shmdt] - Removes a shared memory segment from a process address
   space.

8. [execve()][execve] - Loads a new executable file and replaces the existing
   address space.

9. [exit()][exit] - Destroys an address space and all its regions.

## 4.3 Process Address Space Descriptor

* The process address space is described by [struct mm_struct][mm_struct],
  meaning that there is only one for each process and it is shared between
  userspace threads.

* Threads are in fact identified in the task list by finding all
  [struct task_struct][task_struct]s that have pointers to the same `mm_struct`.

* Each `task_struct` contains all the information the kernel needs about a
  process.

* A unique `mm_struct` is not needed for kernel threads because they will never
  page fault or access the userspace portion (LS - really? Surely
  `copy_to/from_user()`?)

* An exception to this is page faulting within the `vmalloc` space - the page
  fault handling code treats this as a special case and updates the current page
  table with information in the master page table from [init_mm][init_mm].

* Since an `mm_struct` is therefore not needed for kernel threads, the
  `task_struct->mm` field for kernel threads is always `NULL`.

* For some tasks, such as the boot idle task, the `mm_struct` is never set up,
  but, for kernel threads, a call to [daemonize()][daemonize] (LS - no longer a
  function in recent kernels) will call [exit_mm()][exit_mm] (an alias to
  [__exit_mm()][__exit_mm]) to decrement the usage counter.

* Because TLB flushes are extremely expensive (though read a message from Linus
  on [TLB fill performance][linus-tlb] for some interesting information on
  Intel's optimisations in this area), esp. for architectures such as PPC, a
  technique called 'lazy TLB' is employed.

* Lazy TLB avoids unnecessary TLB flushes by processes that do not access the
  userspace page tables because the kernel portion of the address space is
  always visible. The call to [switch_mm()][switch_mm] which ordinarily results
  in a TLB flush is avoided by borrowing the `mm_struct` used by the previous
  task and placing it in `task_struct->active_mm`. This technique has made large
  improvements to context switch times.

* When entering a lazy TLB, the function [enter_lazy_tlb()][enter_lazy_tlb] is
  called to ensure that a `mm_struct` is not shared between processors in SMP
  machines - it's a null operation on UP machines.

* During process exit [start_lazy_tlb()][start_lazy_tlb] is used briefly while
  the process is waiting to be reaped by the parent.

* Let's take a look at [struct mm_struct][mm_struct] again:

```c
struct mm_struct {
        struct vm_area_struct * mmap;           /* list of VMAs */
        rb_root_t mm_rb;
        struct vm_area_struct * mmap_cache;     /* last find_vma result */
        pgd_t * pgd;
        atomic_t mm_users;                      /* How many users with user space? */
        atomic_t mm_count;                      /* How many references to "struct mm_struct" (users count as 1) */
        int map_count;                          /* number of VMAs */
        struct rw_semaphore mmap_sem;
        spinlock_t page_table_lock;             /* Protects task page tables and mm->rss */

        struct list_head mmlist;                /* List of all active mm's.  These are globally strung
                                                 * together off init_mm.mmlist, and are protected

        /* Architecture-specific MM context */
        mm_context_t context;
};
```

* Looking at each field:

1. `mmap` - The head of a linked list of all VMA regions in the address space.

2. `mm_rb` - The VMAs are arranged in a linked list and in a
   [red-black tree][rb-tree] for fast lookups - this is the head of the tree.

3. `mmap_cache` - The VMA found during the last call to [find_vma()][find_vma]
   is stored in this field, on the (usually fairly safe) assumption that the
   area will be used again soon.

4. `pgd` - The PGD for this process.

5. `mm_users` - Reference count of processes accessing the userspace portion of
   this `mm_struct` such as page tables and file mappings. Threads and the
   [swap_out()][swap_out] code, for example, will increment this count and make
   sure an `mm_struct` is not destroyed early. When it drops to 0,
   [exit_mmap()][exit_mmap] will delete all (userspace) mappings and tear down
   the page tables before decrementing `mm_count`.

6. `mm_count` - Reference count of the 'anonymous users' for the `mm_struct`,
   initialised at 1 for the real user. An anonymous user is one that does not
   necessarily care about the userspace portion and is just 'borrowing' the
   `mm_struct`, for example kernel threads that use lazy TLB switching. When
   this count drops to 0, the `mm_struct` can be safely destroyed. We need this
   reference count as well as `mm_users` because anonymous users need
   `mm_struct` to exist even if the userspace mappings get destroyed, and there
   is no point in delaying the teardown of the page tables.

7. `map_count` - Number of VMAs in use.

8. `mmap_sem` - A long-lived lock that protects the VMA list for readers and
   writers. Since users of this lock need it for a long time and may sleep, a
   spinlock is inappropriate. A reader of the list takes this semaphore with
   [down_read()][down_read], and a writer with [down_write()][down_write] before
   taking the `page_table_lock` spinlock when the VMA linked lists are being
   updated.

9. `page_table_lock` - Protects most fields on the `mm_struct`. As well as the
   page tables, it protects the Resident Set Size (RSS) count, `rss`, and the
   VMA from modification.

10. `mmlist` - [struct list_head][list_head] entry for `mm_struct`s
    [init_mm][init_mm]`.mmlist` which is protected by
    [mmlist_lock][mmlist_lock].

11. `start_code`, `end_code` - [Start, end) address for code section.

12. `start_data`, `end_data` - [Start, end) address for data section.

13. `start_brk`, `brk` - [Start, end) address of the heap.

14. `start_stack` - Surprisingly the address at the start of the stack region.

15. `arg_start`, `arg_end` - [Start, end) address for command-line arguments.

16. `env_start`, `env_end` - [Start, end] address for environment variables.

17. `rss` - Resident Set Size (RSS) is the number of resident pages for this
    process. The global zero page is not account for by RSS.

18. `total_vm` - The total memory space occupied by all VMA regions in this
    process.

19. `locked_vm` - The number of resident pages locked in memory.

20. `def_flags` - This has only one possible value if set - `VM_LOCKED` - and is
    used to determine all future mappings are locked by default.

21. `cpu_vm_mask` - A bitmask represents all possible CPUs in an SMP
    system. It's used by an [Inter-Processor Interrupt (IPI)][ipi] to determine
    if a processor should execute a particular function or not. This matters
    during TLB flush for each CPU.

22. `swap_address` - Used by the pageout daemon to record the last address that
    was swapped from when swapping out entire processes.

23. `dumpable` - Set via the [prctl()][prctl] userland function/system call -
    it's only meaningful when a process is being traced.

24. `context` - Architecture-specific MMU context.

* There are a number of functions which interact with `mm_struct`s:

1. [mm_init()][mm_init] - Initialises an `mm_struct` by setting starting values
   for each field, allocating a PGD, initialising spinlocks, etc.

2. [allocate_mm()][allocate_mm] - Allocates an `mm_struct` from the slab
   allocator (see chapter 8 for more on this.)

3. [mm_alloc()][mm_alloc] - Allocates an `mm_struct` using `allocate_mm()` and
   calls `mm_init()` to initialise it.

4. [exit_mmap()][exit_mmap] - Walks through an `mm_struct` and unmaps all VMAs
   associated with it.

5. [copy_mm()][copy_mm] - Makes an exact copy of the current tasks `mm_struct`
   needs for a new task. This is only used during `fork`.

6. [free_mm()][free_mm] - Returns the `mm_struct` to the slab allocator.

### 4.3.1 Allocating a Descriptor

* Two functions are available to allocate an `mm_struct` -
  [allocate_mm()][allocate_mm] which simply a pre-processor macro which
  allocates an `mm_struct` from the slab allocator, whereas
  [mm_alloc()][mm_alloc] calls `allocate_mm()` and initialises it via
  [mm_init()][mm_init].

### 4.3.2 Initialising a Descriptor

* The first `mm_struct` in the system that is initialised is called
  [init_mm][init_mm]. All subsequent `mm_struct`s are copies of a parent
  `mm_struct`, meaning that `init_mm` has to be statically initialised at
  compile time.

* The static initialisation is performed by the macro [INIT_MM()][INIT_MM]:

```c
#define INIT_MM(name) \
{                                                       \
        mm_rb:          RB_ROOT,                        \
        pgd:            swapper_pg_dir,                 \
        mm_users:       ATOMIC_INIT(2),                 \
        mm_count:       ATOMIC_INIT(1),                 \
        mmap_sem:       __RWSEM_INITIALIZER(name.mmap_sem), \
        page_table_lock: SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED,            \
        mmlist:         LIST_HEAD_INIT(name.mmlist),    \
}
```

* After it is established, new `mm_struct`s are created using their parent
  `mm_struct` as a template via [copy_mm()][copy_mm] which uses
  [init_mm()][init_mm] to initialise process-specific fields.

### 4.3.3 Destroying a Descriptor

* When a new user increments the `mm_struct`'s usage count (i.e. `mm_users`),
  this is done with a simple atomic increment
  e.g. `atomic_inc(&mm->mm_users)`.

* However, when this field is decremented, this is done via [mmput()][mmput] so
  that if this field reaches zero, the appropriate data can be properly teared
  down.

* When `mm_users` reaches 0, the mapped regions are destroyed via
  [exit_mmap()][exit_mmap], then the page tables are destroyed because there are
  no longer any users of the userspace portions. The `mm_count` is decremented
  via [mmdrop()][mmdrop], because all users of the page tables and VMAs are
  counted as a single `mm_struct` user.

* As discussed above, when `mm_count` reaches 0, the `mm_struct will be
  destroyed.

## 4.4 Memory Regions

* The full address space of a process is rarely used, only sparse regions are.

* As discussed previously, each region is represented by a
  [struct vm_area_struct][vm_area_struct] which never overlaps and represents a
  set of addresses with the same protection and purpose, for example a read-only
  shared library loaded into the address space, or the process heap.

* A full list of mapped regions that a process has may be viewed via
  `/proc/<PID>/maps`.

* A region might have a number of different structures associated with at as
  shown in the diagram from earlier in the chapter, with the `vm_area_struct`
  containing all the information associated with a region.

* If a region is backed by a file, the [struct file][file] is available via
  `vm_file` which subsequently has a pointer to the file's [struct inode][inode]
  which can be used to access [struct address_space][address_space]:

```c
struct address_space {
        struct list_head        clean_pages;    /* list of clean pages */
        struct list_head        dirty_pages;    /* list of dirty pages */
        struct list_head        locked_pages;   /* list of locked pages */
        unsigned long           nrpages;        /* number of total pages */
        struct address_space_operations *a_ops; /* methods */
        struct inode            *host;          /* owner: inode, block_device */
        struct vm_area_struct   *i_mmap;        /* list of private mappings */
        struct vm_area_struct   *i_mmap_shared; /* list of shared mappings */
        spinlock_t              i_shared_lock;  /* and spinlock protecting it */
        int                     gfp_mask;       /* how to allocate the pages */
};
```

* This structure contains all the private information about the file, including
  filesystem functions that perform filesystem-specific operations such as
  reading and writing pages to disk (i.e. `a_ops`.)

* Taking another look at [struct vm_area_struct][vm_area_struct]:

```c
/*
 * This struct defines a memory VMM memory area. There is one of these
 * per VM-area/task.  A VM area is any part of the process virtual memory
 * space that has a special rule for the page-fault handlers (ie a shared
 * library, the executable area etc).
 */
struct vm_area_struct {
        struct mm_struct * vm_mm;       /* The address space we belong to. */
        unsigned long vm_start;         /* Our start address within vm_mm. */
        unsigned long vm_end;           /* The first byte after our end address
                                           within vm_mm. */

        /* linked list of VM areas per task, sorted by address */
        struct vm_area_struct *vm_next;

        pgprot_t vm_page_prot;          /* Access permissions of this VMA. */
        unsigned long vm_flags;         /* Flags, listed below. */

        rb_node_t vm_rb;

        /*
         * For areas with an address space and backing store,
         * one of the address_space->i_mmap{,shared} lists,
         * for shm areas, the list of attaches, otherwise unused.
         */
        struct vm_area_struct *vm_next_share;
        struct vm_area_struct **vm_pprev_share;

        /* Function pointers to deal with this struct. */
        struct vm_operations_struct * vm_ops;

        /* Information about our backing store: */
        unsigned long vm_pgoff;         /* Offset (within vm_file) in PAGE_SIZE
                                           units, *not* PAGE_CACHE_SIZE */
        struct file * vm_file;          /* File we map to (can be NULL). */
        unsigned long vm_raend;         /* XXX: put full readahead info here. */
        void * vm_private_data;         /* was vm_pte (shared mem) */
};
```

* Looking at each field:

1. `vm_mm` - The [struct mm_struct][mm_struct] this VMA belongs to.

2. `vm_start`, `vm_end` - The [start, end) addresses for this region :].

3. `vm_next` - The next `vm_area_struct` in the region - all VMAs in an address
   space are linked together in an address-ordered singly linked list.
   Interestingly, this is one of a _very_ few cases where a singly-linked list
   is used in the kernel.

4. `vm_page_prot` - Protection flags that are set for each PTE in this VMA,
   described below.

5. `vm_flags` - Protections/properties of the VMA itself, described below.

6. `vm_rb` - As well as being stored in a linked list, all VMAs are stored on a
   red-black tree for fast lookups. This is important for page fault handling
   where finding the correct region quickly is important, especially for a large
   number of mapped regions.

7. `vm_next_share`, `vm_pprev_share` - Links together shared VMA regions based
   on file mappings (e.g. shared libraries.)

8. `vm_ops` - Of type [struct vm_operations_struct][vm_operations_struct]
   containing function pointers for `open()`, `close()` and `nopage()` - used
   for syncing information with the disk.

9. `vm_pgoff` - The page-aligned offset within the file that is memory-mapped.

10. `vm_file` - The [struct file][file] pointer to the file being mapped.

11. `vm_raend` - The end address of a 'read-ahead window'. When a fault occurs,
    a number of additional pages after the desired page will be paged in. This
    field determines how many additional pages are faulted in.

12. `vm_private_data` - Used by some drivers to store private information -
    unused by the memory manager.

* The available PTE protection flags (as used in `vm_page_prot`) are as follows
  (as discussed in 3.2):

1. [_PAGE_PRESENT][_PAGE_PRESENT] - The page is resident in memory and not
   swapped out.
2. [_PAGE_RW][_PAGE_RW] - Page can be written to.
3. [_PAGE_USER][_PAGE_USER] - Page is accessible from user space.
4. [_PAGE_ACCESSED][_PAGE_ACCESSED] - Page has been accessed.
5. [_PAGE_DIRTY][_PAGE_DIRTY] - Page has been written to.
6. [_PAGE_PROTNONE][_PAGE_PROTNONE] - The page is resident, but not accessible.

* The available VMA protection/property flags as set in `vm_flags` are as
  follows:

* Protection flags:

1. `VM_READ` - Pages may be read.
2. `VM_WRITE` - Pages may be written.
3. `VM_EXEC` - Pages may be executed.
4. `VM_SHARED` - Pages may be shared.
5. `VM_DONTCOPY` - VMA will not be copied on fork.
6. `VM_DONTEXPAND` - Prevents a region from being resized. Unused.

* `mmap`-related flags:

1. `VM_MAYREAD` - Allows the `VM_READ` flag to be set.
2. `VM_MAYWRITE` - Allows the `VM_WRITE` flag to be set.
3. `VM_MAYEXEC` - Allows the `VM_EXEC` flag to be set.
4. `VM_MAYSHARE` - Allows the `VM_SHARE` flag to be set.
5. `VM_GROWSDOWN` - Shared segment (probably stack) may grow _down_.
6. `VM_GROWSUP` - Shared segment (probably heap) may grow _up_.
7. `VM_SHM` - Pages are used by shared [SHM][shm] memory segment.
8. `VM_DENYWRITE` - Unused. What `MAP_DENYWRITE` for [mmap()][mmap] translates
   to (linux ignores it.)
9. `VM_EXECUTABLE` - Unused. What `MAP_EXECUTABLE` for [mmap()][mmap] translate
   to (linux ignores it.)
10. `VM_STACK_FLAGS` - Flags used by [setup_arg_pages()][setup_arg_pages] to set
    up the stack.

* Locking flags:

1. `VM_LOCKED` - If set, the pages will not be swapped out. Set by the userland
   function (hence system call) [mlock()][mlock].
2. `VM_IO` - Signals that the area is an `mmap`-ed region for I/O to a device -
   also prevents the region from being core dumped.
3. `VM_RESERVED` - Do not swap out this region, it is being used by device drivers.

* `madvise()` flags, set via the userland function (hence system call)
  [madvise()][madvise]:

1. `VM_SEQ_READ` - A hint that pages will be accessed sequentially.
2. `VM_RAND_READ` - A hint that read-ahead in the region is not useful.

* All the VMA regions are linked together in a linked list via `vm_next`. When
  searching for a free area, it's simple to traverse the list.

* However, when searching for a page in particular (for example during page
  faulting), using the red-black tree is more efficient is it provides average
  O(lg N) search time vs. the O(N) of a linear search. The tree is ordered such
  that lower address than the current node are on the left leaf, and higher
  addresses are on the right.

### 4.4.1 Memory Region Operations

* There are three operations which a VMA may support - `open()`, `close()` and
  `nopage()`, provided via a [struct vm_operations_struct][vm_operations_struct]
  at `vma->vm_ops`:

```c
/*
 * These are the virtual MM functions - opening of an area, closing and
 * unmapping it (needed to keep files on disk up-to-date etc), pointer
 * to the functions called when a no-page or a wp-page exception occurs.
 */
struct vm_operations_struct {
        void (*open)(struct vm_area_struct * area);
        void (*close)(struct vm_area_struct * area);
        struct page * (*nopage)(struct vm_area_struct * area, unsigned long address, int unused);
};
```

* The `open()` and `close()` operations are called every time a region is
  created or deleted. Only a small number of devices care about these, in 2.4.22
  only one filesystem and the System V shared region functionality use them.

* The main callback of interest is the `nopage()` function. It is used during a
  page-fault by [do_no_page()][do_no_page]. It is responsible for locating the
  page in the page cache, or allocating a page and populating it with the
  required data before returning it.

* Most files that are mapped will use a generic `vm_operations_struct` called
  [generic_file_vm_ops][generic_file_vm_ops]:

```c
static struct vm_operations_struct generic_file_vm_ops = {
        nopage:         filemap_nopage,
};
```

* This provides a `nopage` entry of [filemap_nopage()][filemap_nopage] which
  either locates the page in the page cache, or reads the information from disk.

### 4.4.2 File/Device-Backed Memory Regions

* In the event that a region is backed by a file, the `vm_file` field contains a
  [struct address_space][address_space] containing information of relevance to
  the filesystem such as the number of dirty pages that need to be flushed to
  disk.

* Let's review the `address_space` struct once again:

```c
struct address_space {
        struct list_head        clean_pages;    /* list of clean pages */
        struct list_head        dirty_pages;    /* list of dirty pages */
        struct list_head        locked_pages;   /* list of locked pages */
        unsigned long           nrpages;        /* number of total pages */
        struct address_space_operations *a_ops; /* methods */
        struct inode            *host;          /* owner: inode, block_device */
        struct vm_area_struct   *i_mmap;        /* list of private mappings */
        struct vm_area_struct   *i_mmap_shared; /* list of shared mappings */
        spinlock_t              i_shared_lock;  /* and spinlock protecting it */
        int                     gfp_mask;       /* how to allocate the pages */
};
```

* Looking at each field:

1. `clean_pages` - A list of clean pages that require no synchronisation with
   backing storage.
2. `dirty_pages` - A list of dirty pages that do require synchronisation with
   backing storage.
3. `locked_pages` - A list of pages that are locked in memory.
4. `nrpages` - Number of resident pages in use by the address space.
5. `a_ops` - A [struct address_space_operations][address_space_operations] for
   manipulating the filesystem. Each filesystem uses its own, though some may
   use generic functions.
6. `host` - The host inode the file belongs to.
7. `i_mmap` - A list of private mappings using this `address_space`.
8. `i_mmap_shared` - A list of VMAs that share mappings in this `address_space`.
9. `i_shared_lock` - A spinlock used to protect this structure.
10. `gfp_mask` - The mask to use when calling [__alloc_pages()][__alloc_pages]
    for new pages.

* Periodically, the memory manager will need to flush information to disk which
  is performed via
  [struct address_space_operations][address_space_operations]. Let's look at
  this data structure:

```c
struct address_space_operations {
        int (*writepage)(struct page *);
        int (*readpage)(struct file *, struct page *);
        int (*sync_page)(struct page *);
        /*
         * ext3 requires that a successful prepare_write() call be followed
         * by a commit_write() call - they must be balanced
         */
        int (*prepare_write)(struct file *, struct page *, unsigned, unsigned);
        int (*commit_write)(struct file *, struct page *, unsigned, unsigned);
        /* Unfortunately this kludge is needed for FIBMAP. Don't use it */
        int (*bmap)(struct address_space *, long);
        int (*flushpage) (struct page *, unsigned long);
        int (*releasepage) (struct page *, int);
#define KERNEL_HAS_O_DIRECT /* this is for modules out of the kernel */
        int (*direct_IO)(int, struct inode *, struct kiobuf *, unsigned long, int);
#define KERNEL_HAS_DIRECT_FILEIO /* Unfortunate kludge due to lack of foresight */
        int (*direct_fileIO)(int, struct file *, struct kiobuf *, unsigned long, int);
        void (*removepage)(struct page *); /* called when page gets removed from the inode */
};
```

* Looking at each field:

1. `writepage` - Writes a page to disk. The offset within the file to write is
   stored within [struct page][page]. It is up to the filesystem-specific code
   to find the block. See [block_write_full_page()][block_write_full_page] for
   more details.
2. `readpage` - Reads a page from disk. See
   [block_read_full_page()][block_read_full_page] for more details.
3. `sync_page` - Synchronises a dirty page with disk. See
   [block_sync_page()][block_sync_page] for more details.
4. `prepare_write` - This is called before data is copied from userspace into a
   page that will be written to disk. With a journaled filesystem, this ensures
   the filesystem log is up to date. With an unjournaled filesystem, it makes
   sure the pages are allocated. See
   [block_prepare_write()][block_prepare_write] (and subsequently
   [__block_prepare_write()][__block_prepare_write]) for more details.
5. `commit_write` - After the data has been copied from userspace, this function
   is called to commit the information to disk. See
   [block_commit_write()][block_commit_write] (and subsequently
   [__block_commit_write()][__block_commit_write]) for more details.
6. `bmap` - Maps a block so that raw I/O can be performed. It's mostly useful to
   filesystem-specific code, although it is also used when swapping out pages
   that are backed by a swap file instead of a swap partition.
7. `flushpage` - Makes sure there is no I/O pending on a page before releasing
   it. See [discard_bh_page()][discard_bh_page] for more details.
8. `releasepage` - Tries to flush all the buffers associated with a page before
   freeing the page itself. See [try_to_free_buffers()][try_to_free_buffers] for
   more details.
9. `direct_IO` - This function is used when performing direct I/O to an
   inode. The `#define` here is used so external modules can determine whether
   the function is available at compile time as it was only introduced in
   2.4.21.
10. `direct_fileIO` - Used to perform direct I/O with a
    [struct file][file]. Again the `#define#` is present for the same reason as
    above.
11. `removepage` - An optional callback that is used when a page is removed from
    the page cache in
    [remove_page_from_inode_queue()][remove_page_from_inode_queue].

### 4.4.3 Creating a Memory Region

* The system call [mmap()][mmap] is provided for creating new memory regions
  within a process. For i386, the function calls [sys_mmap2()][sys_mmap2] which
  calls [do_mmap2()][do_mmap2] directly, with the same parameters.

* `do_mmap2()` is responsible for determining the parameters needed by
  [do_mmap_pgoff()][do_mmap_pgoff] which is the principal function for creating
  new areas for _all_ architectures.

* `do_mmap2()` first clears the `MAP_DENYWRITE` and `MAP_EXECUTABLE` bits from
  the `flags` parameter because they are ignored by linux.

* If a file is being mapped, `do_mmap2()` will look up its [struct file][file]
  based on the file descriptor passed a parameter, then acquire the
  `mm_struct->mmap_sem` semaphore before calling
  [do_mmap_pgoff()][do_mmap_pgoff].

* `do_mmap_pgoff()` starts by doing some sanity checks:

1. Ensuring that the appropriate filesystem or device functions are available if
  a file or device is being mapped.

2. Ensuring that the size of the mapping is page-aligned and doesn't attempt to
  create a mapping in the kernel portion of the address space.

3. Ensuring that the size of mapping does not overflow the range of `pgoff`.

4. Ensuring that the process does not have too many mapped regions already.

* The rest of the function is rather large and involved, but can
  broadly-speaking be described by the following steps:

1. Sanity check the parameters.

2. Find a free linear address space large enough for the memory mapping. If a
   filesystem or device-specific `get_unmapped_area()` function is provided in
   the file's `f_op` field (of type [struct file_operations][file_operations])
   it is used, otherwise [arch_get_unmapped_area()][arch_get_unmapped_area] is
   called.

3. Calculate the VM flags and check them against the file access permissions.

4. If an old area exists where the mapping is to take place, fix it up so it is
   suitable for for the new mapping (i.e.

5. Allocate a [struct vm_area_struct][vm_area_struct] from the slab allocator and
   fill in its entries.

6. Link in the new VMA.

7. Call the filesystem or device-specific `mmap` function.

8. Update statistics and exit.

### (LS) Memory Region API

__NOTE:__ This is present in the book but not relevant to the any of the
sections below which reference these functions, so for clarity I'm putting this
into a separate section.

* [find_vma()][find_vma] - Finds the VMA that _covers_ a given
  address. Importantly, if the region does not exist, it returns the VMA
  _closest_ to the requested address.

* [find_vma_prev()][find_vma_prev] - The same as `find_vma()` except it also
  provides the VMA pointing to the returned VMA. It is rarely used as typically
  red-black tree nodes will be required as well so `find_vma_prepare()` is used
  instead ([sys_mprotect()][sys_mprotect] is a notable exception.)

* [find_vma_prepare()][find_vma_prepare] - The same as `find_vma_prev()` except
  it will also provide red-black tree nodes needed to perform an insertion into
  the tree.

* [find_vma_intersection()][find_vma_intersection] - Returns the VMA that
  intersects the specified address _range_. This is useful for checking whether
  a linear address region is in use by _any_ VMA.

* [vma_merge()][vma_merge] - Attempts to expand the specified VMA to cover a new
  address range. If the VMA can't be expanded forwards, then the next VMA is
  checked to see if it might be expanded backwards to cover the address range
  instead. Regions may be merged only if there is no file/device mapping, and
  permissions match.

* [get_unmapped_area()][get_unmapped_area] - Returns the address of a free
  region of memory large enough to cover the requested size of memory. Used
  principally when a new VMA is to be created.

* [insert_vm_struct()][insert_vm_struct] - Inserts a new VMA into a linear
  address space.

### 4.4.4 Finding a Mapped Memory Region

* A common operation is to determine the VMA that a particular address belongs
  to, such as during operations like page faulting. This is handled via
  [find_vma()][find_vma].

* `find_vma()` first checks the `mmap_cache` field which caches the result of
  the last call to `find_vma()` as it is likely the same region will be needed a
  few times in succession.

* If `mmap_cache` doesn't match, the red-black tree stored in the `mm_rb` field
  is traversed.

* If the desired address is not contained within any VMA, the function will
  return the VMA _closest_ to the requested address. This is somewhat unexpected
  and confusing, so it's important callers double-check to ensure the returned
  VMA contains the desired address (or take the appropriate action if not.)

* [find_vma_prev()][find_vma_prev] is the same is `find_vma()` but also returns
  a pointer to the VMA prior to the located one (they are linked together using
  a singly-linked-list so this makes sense.) It is very similar to
  [find_vma_prepare()][find_vma_prepare] which additionally provides red-black
  tree nodes needed for inserting into the tree.

* These previous-VMA functions are rarely used but a notable use case is where
  two VMAs are being compared to determine if they may be merged. An additional
  use case is where a memory region is being removed and the singly-linked-list
  needs updating.

* The last function of note for searching VMAs is
  [find_vma_intersection()][find_vma_intersection] which is used to find a VMA
  that overlaps a given address range. The most notable use case for this is
  during a call to [sys_brk()][sys_brk] when a region is growing upwards - it's
  important to ensure the growing region will not overlap an old region.

### 4.4.5 Finding a Free Memory Region

* When a new area is to be memory mapped, a free region has to be found that is
  large enough to contain the new mapping. The function responsible for finding
  a free area is [get_unmapped_area()][get_unmapped_area].

* If a device is being mapped, such as a video card, the associated
  `get_unmapped_area()` function is called (via the
  [struct file_operations][file_operations] `f_op` field.) This is because
  devices or files may have additional requirements for mapping above and beyond
  the generic code, e.g. alignment requirements.

* If there are no special requirements, the architecture-specific function
  [arch_get_unmapped_area()][arch_get_unmapped_area] is called. There is a
  generic version of this available for architectures which don't need to do
  anything unusual here (i386 included.)

### 4.4.6 Inserting a Memory Region

* (In theory) the principal function for inserting a new memory region is
  [insert_vm_struct()][insert_vm_struct], which subsequently calls
  [__vma_link()][__vma_link] to link in the new VMA.

* However, this function is rarely called directly because it does not increase
  the `map_count` field, rather [__insert_vm_struct()][__insert_vm_struct] is
  used which performs the same tasks but also increments this field. LS: the
  code is literally duplicated apart from `mm->map_count++` :)

* Two varieties of linking functions are provided - [vma_link()][vma_link] and
  [__vma_link()][__vma_link].

* `vma_link()` is intended for use when no locks are held. It'll acquire all the
  necessary locks, including locking the file if the VMA is a file mapping
  before calling `__vma_link()` which assumes the appropriate locks are held.

* Many functions do not use the [insert_vm_struct()][insert_vm_struct] functions
  and instead prefer to call [find_vma_prepare()][find_vma_prepare] themselves
  followed by a later [vma_link()][vma_link] to avoid having to traverse the
  tree multiple times.

* The linking in [__vma_link()][__vma_link] consists of three stages that are
  contained in 3 separate functions:

1. [__vma_link_list()][__vma_link_list] inserts the VMA into the linear,
   singly-linked list. If it is the first mapping in the address space, it will
   become the red-black tree root node.

2. The red-black node is then linked into the tree via
   [__vma_link_rb()][__vma_link_rb].

3. Finally, the file share mappings are fixed up via
   [__vma_link_file()][__vma_link_file] which inserts the VMA into the linked
   list of VMAs using the `vm_pprev_share` and `vm_next_share` fields.

### 4.4.7 Merging Contiguous Regions

* Prior to 2.4.22 linux used to have a `merge_segments()` function that merged
  adjacent regions of memory if the file and permissions matched. However, this
  ended up being overly expensive (esp. in [sys_mprotect()][sys_mprotect]) so
  was removed.

* The equivalent function in 2.4.22 is [vma_merge()][vma_merge] and is only used
  in two places.

* The first is [do_mmap_pgoff()][do_mmap_pgoff] (via [sys_mmap2()][sys_mmap2]),
  which calls it if an anonymous region is being mapped, as these are frequently
  mergeable.

* The second is during [do_brk()][do_brk], which is expanding one region into a
  newly allocated one where the two regions should be merged. Rather than
  merging two regions, `vma_merge()` checks if an existing region can be
  expanded to satisfy the new allocation, negating the need to create a new
  region (as discussed previously, a region can be expanded if there are no file
  or device mappings and the permissions of the two areas are the same.)

* Regions are merged elsewhere, although no function is explicitly called to
  perform the merging, for example in [sys_mprotect()][sys_mprotect] during the
  fixup of areas where two regions will be merged if permissions match after a
  permissions change, or during a call to [move_vma()][move_vma] when it is
  likely that similar regions will be located beside each other.

### 4.4.8 Remapping and Moving a Memory Region

* [mremap()][mremap] is a userland function hence system call that allows an
  existing memory mapping to be grown or shrunk. It is implemented by
  [sys_mremap()][sys_mremap] which may move a memory region if it is growing or
  would overlap another region, and `MREMAP_FIXED` is not specified in the flags.

* If a region is to be moved, [do_mremap()][do_mremap] first calls
  [get_unmapped_area()][get_unmapped_area] to find a region large enough to
  contain the new resized mapping and then calls [move_vma()][move_vma] to move
  the old VMA to the new location.

* `move_vma()` does the following:

1. It first checks if the new location can be merged with the VMAs adjacent to
  the new location. If they cannot be merged a VMA is allocated, literally one
  PTE at a time.

2. [move_page_tables()][move_page_tables] is called, which copies all the page
   table entries from the old mapping to the new one. Though there might be
   better ways of moving the page tables, doing it this way makes error recovery
   trivial as backtracking is relatively straightforward.

3. The contents of the pages are not copied, rather
   [zap_page_range()][zap_page_range] is called to swap out or remove all the
   pages from the old mapping, and the normal page fault handing code will swap
   the pages back in from backing storage/files or will call the device-specific
   `do_nopage()` function.

### 4.4.9 Locking a Memory Region

* Linux can lock pages from an address range into memory using the userland
  function (hence system call) [mlock()][mlock], which is implemented by
  [sys_mlock()][sys_mlock]. Them being 'locked' means that that they will not be
  swapped out to disk.

* At a high level `mlock` is simple - it creates a VMA for the address range to
  be locked, sets the `VM_LOCKED` flag on it and forces all the pages to be
  present via [make_pages_present()][make_pages_present].

* [mlockall()][mlockall] is another userland function/system call that does the
  same thing as `mlock()` only for every VMA in the calling process. It is
  implemented via [sys_mlockall()][sys_mlockall].

* Both `mlock` and `mlockall` use [do_mlock()][do_mlock] to do the heavy
  lifting - finding the affected VMAs and deciding which function is needed to
  fix up the regions.

* There are some limitations as to what memory can be locked:

1. The address range must be page-aligned, because VMAs are page-aligned. This
   can be addressed simply by rounding the range up to the nearest page-aligned
   range.

2. The process limit `RLIMIT_MLOCK` may not be exceeded. This means that each
   process may only lock half of physical memory at a time. This seems a bit
   silly since processes can fork and continue to lock further pages, however
   you need root permissions to do it so if a system admin is being this stupid
   it's their funeral :)

### 4.4.10 Unlocking the Region

* The userland functions (hence system calls) [munlock()][munlock] and
  [munlockall()][munlockall] provide the corollary for the locking functions and
  are implemented by [sys_munlock()][sys_munlock] and
  [sys_munlockall()][sys_munlockall] respectively, which both rely on
  [do_mmap()][do_mmap] to fix up memory regions.

* These functions are a lot simpler than the locking ones as they do not have to
make as many checks as them.

### 4.4.11 Fixing Up Regions After Locking

* When locking or unlocking, VMAs will be affected in one of four ways, each of
  which must be fixed up by [mlock_fixup()][mlock_fixup]:

1. The locking affects the whole of the VMA -
   [mlock_fixup_all()][mlock_fixup_all] is called to fix it up.

2. The locking affects the start of the VMA - this means that a new VMA will
   have to be allocated to map the new area. This is handled via
   [mlock_fixup_start()][mlock_fixup_start].

3. The locking affects the end of the VMA - this is handled via the aptly named
   [mlock_fixup_end()][mlock_fixup_end].

4. The locking affects the middle of the VMA - unsurprisingly, this is handled
   via [mlock_fixup_middle()][mlock_fixup_middle]. This case requires two new
   VMAs to be allocated.

* Interestingly, VMAs created as a result of locking are _never_ merged, even
  when unlocked. This is because it is presumed that processes that lock regions
  will need to lock the same regions over + over again so it's not worth
  constantly merging and splitting them.

### 4.4.12 Deleting a Memory Region

* The function responsible for deleting memory regions or parts of memory
  regions is [do_munmap()][do_munmap].

* The process for this is relatively simple compared to the other memory
  region-related operations and is divided into 3 parts:

1. Fix up the red-black tree for the region that is about to be unmapped.

2. Release pages and PTEs related to the region to be unmapped.

3. Fix up the regions if a hole has been created.

* To ensure that the red-black tree is ordered correctly, all VMAs that are
  affected by the unmap are placed on a linked list local variable called `free`
  then deleted from the red-black tree via [rb_erase()][rb_erase].

* The regions, if they still exist, will be added with their new addresses later
  during the fixup.

* Next, the linked-list VMAs on `free` are walked to ensure it isn't a _partial_
  unmapping, if it is then this needs to be handled carefully.

* Regardless of whether the region is being partially or fully unmapped,
  [remove_shared_vm_struct()][remove_shared_vm_struct] is called to remove share
  file mappings. If it is partial, this will be recreated during fixup.

* Next, [zap_page_range()][zap_page_range] is called to remove all pages
  associated with the region about to be unmapped.

* [unmap_fixup()][unmap_fixup] is then called to handle partial unmappings.

* Finally, [free_pgtables()][free_pgtables] is called to try to free up all page
  table entries associated with the unmapped region. This isn't an exhaustive
  process - only full PGD directories and their entries are unmapped. This is
  because a finer-grained freeing of page table entries would be too expensive
  for data structures that are both small and likely to be used again.

### 4.4.13 Deleting All Memory Regions

* When a process exits it's necessary to unmap all VMAs associated with a
  [struct mm_struct][mm_struct]. This is achieved via [exit_mmap()][exit_mmap].

* `exit_mmap()` simply flushes the CPU cache before walking through the linked
  list of VMAs, unmapping each of them in turn and freeing up the associated
  pages before flushing the TLB and deleting the page table entries.

## 4.5 Exception Handling

* A very important part of a VM system is how kernel address space exceptions
  (those that aren't bugs) are caught.

* There are two situations where a bad reference may occur:

1. A process sends an invalid pointer to the kernel via a system call which the
   kernel must be able to safely trap because the only check made initially is
   that the address is below `PAGE_OFFSET`.

2. The kernel uses [copy_from_user()][copy_from_user] or
   [copy_to_user()][copy_to_user] to read/write data from userspace.

* At compile time the linker creates an exception table in the
  [__ex_table][__ex_table] section of the kernel code segment, which starts at
  [__start___ex_table][__start___ex_table] and ends (exclusive bound) at
  [__stop___ex_table][__stop___ex_table].

* Each entry in the exception table is of type
  [struct exception_table_entry][exception_table_entry] which contains a pair of
  addresses - `insn` and `fixup` - execution point and fixup routine respectively.

* When an exception occurs that the page fault handler can't manage, it calls
  [search_exception_table()][search_exception_table] to see if a fixup routine
  has been provided for an error at the faulting instruction. If module support
  is enabled, each module's exception table will also be searched.

* If the address of hte current exception is found in the table, the
  corresponding location of the fixup code is returned and executed. Section 4.7
  will go into more detail as to how this is used to trap bad reads/writes to
  userspace.

## 4.6 Page Faulting

* Pages in the process linear address space are not necessarily resident in
  memory.

* For one, allocations made on behalf of a process are not satisfied
  immediately, because the space is simply reserved within the
  [struct vm_area_struct][vm_area_struct]. Alternatively, a page may have been
  swapped out to backing storage, or a user may be attempting to write to a
  read-only page.

* Linux, like many operating system, has a __Demand Fetch__ policy for dealing
  with pages that are not resident - a page is only fetched from backing storage
  when the hardware raises a page fault exception, which the operating system
  traps and allocates a page.

* (At the time of 2.4.22) the characteristics of backing storage suggest
  prefetching would help, but linux is pretty primitive in this regard.

* When a page is paged in from swap space, a number of pages up to
  `2^page_cluster` ([page_cluster][page_cluster] is a global var set in
  [swap_setup()][swap_setup]) are read in by
  [swapin_readahead()][swapin_readahead] and placed in the swap cache.

* Unfortunately, there is only a chance that pages likely to be used soon would
  be adjacent in the swap area which makes it a poor pre-paging policy, one that
  adapts to program behaviour would work better (LS - I am sure this is done a
  lot better in the modern kernel!)

* There are two types of page fault - major and minor. Major page faults occur
  when data has to be read from disk, which is an expensive operation. Those
  that do not require this are considered minor.

* Major and minor page faults are tracked in the `maj_flt` and `min_flt` fields
  of [struct task_struct][task_struct].

* The page fault handler needs to be able to deal with the following types of
  page fault (written in the form severity - description - resolution):

1. Minor - Region valid but page not allocated - Allocate a page frame from the
   physical page allocator.

2. Minor - Region not valid but is beside an expandable region like the stack -
   Expand the region and allocate a page.

3. Minor - Page swapped out, but present in swap cache - Re-establish the page
   in the process page tables and drop a reference to the swap cache.

4. Major - Page swapped out to backing storage - Find where the page with
   information is stored in the PTE and read it from disk.

5. Minor - Page write when marked read-only - If the page is a COW page make a
   copy of it, mark it writable and assign it to the process, otherwise send a
   `SIGSEGV` signal.

6. Error - Region is invalid or process has no permissions to access - Send a
   `SIGSEGV` signal.

7. Minor - Fault occurred in the kernel portion of address space - If the fault
   occurred in the `vmalloc` area of the address space, the current process page
   tables are updated against the master page table held by
   [init_mm][init_mm]. This is the only _valid_ kernel page fault that may
   occur.

8. Error - Fault occurred in the userspace region while in kernel mode - this
   means kernel code did not copy from userspace properly and caused a page
   fault. This is a kernel bug that is taken quite seriously.

* Each architecture registers an architecture-specific for the handling of page
  faults. Though this function can be named arbitrarily, it's normally (and
  certain on i386) called [do_page_fault()][do_page_fault].

* This function is provided with a lot of information - the address of the
  fault, whether the page was not found or there was a protection error, whether
  it was a read/write fault, whether the fault occurred in user/kernel space and
  more.

* `do_page_fault()` is responsible for determining which type of fault has
  occurred and how it should be handled by the architecture-independent code:

```

* [handle_mm_fault()][handle_mm_fault] is an architecture-independent top-level
  functino for faulting in a page from backing storage, performing
  [Copy-On-Write (COW)][cow] amongst other tasks. If it returns 1, the fault was
  minor, if it returns 2 the fault was major, 0 sends a `SIGBUS` error and any
  other value invokes the out-of-memory handler.

### 4.6.1 Handing a Page Fault

* After the exception handler has decided the fault is a _valid_ page fault in a
  _valid_ memory region, the architecture-independent
  [handle_mm_fault()][handle_mm_fault] function takes over.

* `handle_mm_fault()` allocates the required page table entries if they don't
  already exist and calls [handle_pte_fault()][handle_pte_fault].

* `handle_pte_fault()` checks whether the PTE is present or not via
  [pte_present()][pte_present] and [pte_none()][pte_none/3lvl]. If no PTE has
  been allocated - `pte_none()` returns true - then [do_no_page()][do_no_page]
  which handles __Demand Allocation__.

* If the PTE is present, then a page has been swapped out to disk and
  [do_swap_page()][do_swap_page] handles __Demand Paging__.


* There is a rare exception where swapped out pages belonging to a virtual file
  are handled by [do_no_page()][do_no_page] - page faulting within a virtual
  file. This case is discussed in section 12.4.

* If the PTE is write-protected, [do_wp_page()][do_wp_page] is called, as the
  page is a [COW][cow] page - as discussed previously, this is a page that is
  shared between multiple processes (usually parent and child) until a write
  occurs, after while a private copy is made for the process performing the
  write.

* The kernel is able to recognise a COW page because the VMA for the region is
  marked writable even though the individual PTE is not.

* If the page is not COW, the page is simply marked dirty because it has been
  written to.

* Finally, a page can be read and be marked present and still encounter a
  fault - this happens for some architectures which do not have a 3-level page
  table. In this case, the PTE is simply established and marked young.

### 4.6.2 Demand Allocation

* When a process accesses a page for the very first time, the page has to be
  allocated and (possibly) filled with data via [do_no_page()][do_no_page].

* Additionally, if the [struct vm_operations_struct][vm_operations_struct]
  associated with the parent VMA (`vm->vm_ops`) provides a `nopage()` function,
  it is called - this matters for example for memory-mapped devices such as
  video cards which need to allocate page and supply data on access, or perhaps
  for a mapped file which must retrieve its data from backing storage.

* Let's consider a couple of cases:

#### Handling Anonymous Pages

* If the `vm->vm_ops` field is not filled or a `nopage()` function is not
  supplied, the function [do_anonymous_page()][do_anonymous_page] is called to
  handle an anonymous access.

* There are two cases to consider:

1. First time read - this is an easy case to deal with, because no data
   exists. In this case the system-wide [empty_zero_page][empty_zero_page],
   which is just a page of zeros, is mapped for the PTE and it is marked
   write-protected. On i386 this page is zeroed out in [mem_init][mem_init].

2. First time write - [alloc_page()][alloc_page] is called to allocate a free
   page (discussed further in chapter 6), which is zero-filled by
   [clear_user_highpage()][clear_user_highpage]. Assuming the page was
   successfully allocated, the `rss` field in the [struct mm_struct][mm_struct]
   will be incremented and `flush_page_to_ram()` is called on some brain-dead
   architectures that aren't i386 :) The page is then inserted on the LRU lists
   so it may be reclaimed later by the page reclaiming code. Finally, the page
   table entries for the process are updated for the new mapping.

#### Handling File/Device-Backed Pages

* If a VMA is backed by a file or device, a `nopage()` function will be provided
  within the VMA's `vm_ops` [struct vm_operations_struct][vm_operations_struct].

* In the case of a file-backed VMA, the function
  [filemap_nopage()][filemap_nopage] is often used for this - providing
  functionality to allocate a page and read a page-sized amount of data from
  disk.

* Pages backed by a virtual file, such as those provided by shmfs for example
  (later renamed to tmpfs), will use the function [shmem_nopage()][shmem_nopage]
  (see chapter 12 for more details on this.)

* Each device driver provides a different `nopage()` - we don't care about the
  internals of each, so long as it returns a `struct page` to use.

* Once the page is returned, checks are made to ensure a page was successfully
  allocated and appropriate errors were returned if not.

* A check is then performed to see if an early COW break should take place - if
  the fault is caused by a write to the page and the ¬VM_SHARED` flag is not set
  in the managing VMA then a break will occur.

* An 'early COW break' is a case of allocating a new page and copying the data
  across before reducing the reference count to the page returned by the
  `nopage()` function.

* In either case, a check is then made using [pte_none()][pte_none/3lvl] to
  ensure that a PTE is not already in the apge table that is about to be
  used. This is because, in SMP, two faults could occur for the same page at
  close to the same time and because the spinlocks are not held for the full
  duration of the fault, the check has to be made at the last instant. If there
  has been no race, the PTE is assigned, stats are updated and the brain-dead
  architecture hooks for cache coherency are called.

### 4.6.3 Demand Paging

* When a page is swapped out to backing storage, the function
  [do_swap_page()][do_swap_page] is responsible for reading the page back in
  (with the exception of virtual files, which are covered in chapter 12.)

* The information needed to find the page in the swap is stored within the PTE
  itself (LS - but surely it's swapped out?! Maybe there's a shared page it
  references which it indexes in to? Confused). Because pages may be shared
  between multiple processes, they cannot always be swapped out immediately -
  instead they are placed within the 'swap cache' in this situation.

* A shared page cannot be swapped out immediately because (in 2.4.22) there is
  no way of mapping a [struct page][page] to all the PTEs of each process it is
  shared between - searching the page tables of all processes is simply too
  expensive. In more recent kernels (well at least in early 2.6, the
  implementation may have changed since) there is 'Reverse Mapping (RMAP)' which
  provides means of determining this information.

* Given there is a swap cache, it's possible that when a fault occurs the page
  still exists there. In this case, the reference count to the page is simply
  increased and it is placed within the process page tables again, and registers
  as a minor page fault.

* If the page exists only on disk, [swapin_readahead()][swapin_readahead] is
  called which reads the requested page _and_ a number of pages after it. The
  number of pages read is determined by [page_cluster][page_cluster] (on i386
  this is set to 3, or 2 if there is less than 16MiB of RAM on the system.)

* The number of pages read is `2^page_cluster`, unless a bad or empty swap entry
  is encountered. Read-ahead is performed on the assumption that seeking is the
  most expensive operation time-wise, so after it is complete succeeding pages
  should also be read in.

### 4.6.4 COW Pages

* Once upon a time a fork would mean the entire parent address space would have
  to be duplicated - this is an extremely expensive operation because it could
  result a significant percentage of the process would have to be swapped in
  from backing storage.

* [Copy-on-Write (COW)][cow] is a solution to this issue - during a fork the
  PTEs of both the parent and the child process are made read-only so that when
  a write occurs, there will be a page fault.

* As discussed previously, linux recognises a COW page because even though the
  PTE is write-protected, the controlling VMA shows the region is writable.

* The function [do_wp_page()][do_wp_page] handles this case by making a copy of
  the page and assigning it to the writing process. If necessary, a new swap
  slot will be reserved for the page.

* Using the COW method, only the page table entries have to be copied during a
  fork, rather more efficient overall!

# 4.7 Copying to/from Userspace

* It is not safe to access memory in the process address space directly, because
  there is no way to quickly check if the page addressed is resident or not.

* Linux relies on the MMU to raise exceptions when the address is invalid and
  use the Page Fault Exception handler to catch the exception and clean up.

* When we are in kernel mode we can't do this in the usual way as we don't have
  anybody to clean up our mess for us, as previously discussed kernel page
  faults only make sense when interacting with the `vmalloc` region.

* In the i386 case, checks are performed by [access_ok()][access_ok] before
  [__copy_user()][__copy_user] or [__copy_user_zeroing()][__copy_user_zeroing]
  which use assembly to provide fixup code for cases where the address really is
  fucked - this will be found by
  [search_exception_table()][search_exception_table] on page fault and trapped,
  preventing the general kernel page fault code from running and a potential
  oops, and instead running fixup code which zeros the remaining buffer space.

* Let's take a look at the functions for safely copying data to/from userland:

1. [copy_from_user()][copy_from_user] -Copies bytes from the user address space
   to the kernel address space.
2. [copy_to_user()][copy_to_user] - Copies bytes from the kernel address space
   to the user address space.
3. [copy_user_page()][copy_user_page] - Copies data to an anonymous or COW page
   in userspace. Brain-dead architectures need to be careful about cache
   aliasing. LS - Doesn't seem to do any checks?!
4. [clear_user_page()][clear_user_page] - Similar to `copy_user_page()`, only it
   zeros a page instead. LS - doesn't seem to do any checks?!
5. [get_user()][get_user] - Copies an integer value from the user address space
   to the kernel address space.
6. [put_user()][put_user] - Copies an integer value from the kernel address
   space to the user address space.
7. [strncpy_from_user()][strncpy_from_user] - Copies a null-terminated string of
   maximum size as specified from the user address space to the kernel address
   space.
8. [strlen_user()][strlen_user] - Determines the length (with specified upper
   bound) of the userspace string including the trailing NULL byte.
9. [access_ok()][access_ok] - Returns non-zero if the specified userspace block
   of memory is valid, or 0 if not.

* Generally these functions are implemented as macros and all behave relatively
  similarly.

* Considering [copy_from_user()][copy_from_user] on i386 - if the size of the
  copy is known at compile time, it uses
  [__constant_copy_from_user()][__constant_copy_from_user], otherwise it uses
  [__generic_copy_from_user()][__generic_copy_from_user].

* In the constant copy case, the code eventually calls
  [__constant_copy_user()][__constant_copy_user] which optimises based on the
  bytes of the 'stride' of the data being read.

* In the generic copy case, it eventually calls
  [__copy_user_zeroing()][__copy_user_zeroing]. As discussed above, this sets an
  exception table for [search_exception_table()][search_exception_table] to find
  which allows fixup code to zero the remains of the buffer.

* Doing things this way allows the kernel to safely access userspace without
  performing overly expensive checks first.
