# Chapter 4: Process Address Space

* One of the major advantages of virtual memory is that each process has its own
  virtual address space, mapped to physical memory by the operating system.

* This chapter explores the address space as seen by a process, and how it is
  managed by linux.

* The kernel treats the userspace portion of the address space very differently
  from the kernel portion. For example, allocations for the kernel are satisfied
  immediately and are visible globally, no matter which process is current.

* An exception to this however is [vmalloc()][vmalloc] (and consequently
  [__vmalloc()][__vmalloc]), as it causes a minor page fault to occur to
  synchronise the process page tables with the reference page tables, however
  the page will still be allocated immediately upon request.

* For a process, space is simply reserved in the linear address space by
  pointing a page table entry to a read-only globally visible page filled with
  zeros.

* When the process tries to write to this table a page fault is triggered
  causing the kernel to allocate a new zeroed page and assign it to the PTE and
  mark it writeable. It's zeroed so it appears precisely the same as the global
  zero-filled page.

* The userspace portion of virtual memory is not trusted nor presumed
  constant. After each context switch, the userspace portion of the linear
  address space can change except when a 'Lazy TLB' switch is used (discussed in
  4.3.)

* As a result, the kernel has to be configured to catch all exceptions and
  address errors raised from userspace (discussed in 4.5.)

## 4.1 Linear Address Space

* From a user perspective, the address space is a flat, linear address
  space. The kernel's view is rather different - the address space is split
  between userspace which potentially changes on context switch and the kernel
  address space which remains constant.

* The split is determined by the value of [PAGE_OFFSET][PAGE_OFFSET] -
  0xc0000000 on i386 - meaning that 3GiB is available for the rpocess to use
  while the remaining 1GiB is always mapped by the kernel.

* Diagramatically the kernel address space looks as follows:
