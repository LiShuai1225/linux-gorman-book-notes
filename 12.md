# Chapter 12: Shared Memory Virtual Filesystem

* Sharing a region of memory backed by a file or device is simply a case of
  calling [mmap()][mmap] with the `MAP_SHARED` flag.

* Regardless, there are 2 important cases where an _anonymous_ region needs to
  be shared between processes:

1. When an `mmap()` with `MAP_SHARED` is used without file backing - these
   regions will be shared between a parent and a child process after a
   [fork()][fork] is executed.

2. A region explicitly sets up an anonymous mapping via (userland calls)
   [shmget()][shmget] and attaches to the virtual address space with
   [shmat()][shmat].

* When pages within a VMA are backed by a file on disk, the interface used is
  fairly straightforward. To read a page during a page fault, the required
  `nopage()` function is found in the
  [struct vm_area_struct][vm_area_struct]`->vm_ops` field and the required
  `writepage()` function is found in the
  [struct address_space_operations][address_space_operations] using
  `inode->i_mapping->a_ops` or alternatively `page->mapping->a_ops`.

* When normal file operations are taking place such as `mmap()`, [read()][read]
  and [write()][write], the [struct file_operations][file_operations] with the
  appropriate functions is found using `inode->i_fop`. The diagram shown in 4.2
  goes into more detail.

* The interface is nice and clean and is conceptually easy to understand, but it
  does not help _anonymous_ pages as there is no file backing there.

* To keep this nice interface, linux creates an artificial file backing for
  anonymous pages using a RAM-based filesystem where each VMA is backed by a
  file in this filesystem.

* Every inode in the artificial filesystem is placed on a linked list,
  [shmem_inodes][shmem_inodes], so they can be easily located.

* Overall this approach allows the same file-based interface to be used without
  treating anonymous pages as a special case.

* The filesystem comes in two variations in 2.4.22 - `shm` and `tmpfs`. They
  share core functionality and mainly different in what they're used for - `shm`
  is used by the kernel for creating file backings for anonymous pages and for
  backing regions created by [shmget()][shmget], the filesystem is mounted by
  [kern_mount()][kern_mount] so it's mounted internally and isn't visible to
  users.

* `tmpfs` is a temporary file system that is often mounted at `/tmp` publicly as
  as fast RAM-based temp fs. A secondary use for tmpfs is to mount `/tmp/shm`
  which allows [mmap()][mmap]-ing of files there in order to share information
  as a form of [IPC][ipc]. Regardless of the type of use, a sysadmin has to
  explicitly mount the tmpfs.

## 12.1 Initialising the Virtual Filesystem

* The virtual filesystem is initialised by [init_tmpfs()][init_tmpfs] either
  during system start or when the module is being loaded. This does the
  following:

1. Mounts `tmpfs` and `shm`, with `shm` mounted internally via
   [kern_mount()][kern_mount].

2. Calculates the maximum number of blocks and inodes that can exist in the
   filesystem.

3. As part of the registration, the function
   [shmem_read_super()][shmem_read_super] is used as a callback to populate a
   [struct super_block][super_block] with more information about the
   filesystems, such as making the block size equal to the page size.

* Every inode created in the filesystem will have a
  [struct shmem_inode_info][shmem_inode_info] associated with it containing
  private information specific to the filesystem.

* [SHMEM_I()][SHMEM_I] takes an inode as a parameter and returns a pointer to a
  `struct shmem_inode_info`, bridging the gap between the two. Taking a look at
  the latter:

```c
struct shmem_inode_info {
        spinlock_t              lock;
        unsigned long           next_index;
        swp_entry_t             i_direct[SHMEM_NR_DIRECT]; /* for the first blocks */
        void                    **i_indirect; /* indirect blocks */
        unsigned long           swapped;    /* data pages assigned to swap */
        unsigned long           flags;
        struct list_head        list;
        struct inode            *inode;
};
```

* Considered each field:

1. `lock` - Spinlock protecting the inode information from concurrent accesses.

2. `next_index` - Index of the last page being used in the file. This will be
   different from `inode->i_size` when a file is being truncated.

3. `i_direct` - direct block containing the first
   [SHMEM_NR_DIRECT][SHMEM_NR_DIRECT] swap vectors in use by the file (see
   12.4.1.)

4. `i_indirect` - Pointer to the first indirect block (see 12.4.1.)

5. `swapped` - Count of the number of pages belonging to the file that are

   currently swapped out.

6. `flags` - Currently only used to determine if the file belongs to shared
   region set by [shmget()][shmget]. It is set by specifying `SHM_LOCK` when
   calling `shmget()` and unlocked via `SHM_UNLOCK`.

7. `list` - List of all inodes used by the filesystem.

8. `inode` - Pointer to the parent inode.
