# Chapter 12: Shared Memory Virtual Filesystem

* Sharing a region of memory backed by a file or device is simply a case of
  calling [mmap()][mmap] with the `MAP_SHARED` flag.

* Regardless, there are 2 important cases where an _anonymous_ region needs to
  be shared between processes:

1. When an `mmap()` with `MAP_SHARED` is used without file backing - these
   regions will be shared between a parent and a child process after a
   [fork()][fork] is executed.

2. A region explicitly sets up an anonymous mapping via (userland calls)
   [shmget()][shmget] and attaches to the virtual address space with
   [shmat()][shmat].

* When pages within a VMA are backed by a file on disk, the interface used is
  fairly straightforward. To read a page during a page fault, the required
  `nopage()` function is found in the
  [struct vm_area_struct][vm_area_struct]`->vm_ops` field and the required
  `writepage()` function is found in the
  [struct address_space_operations][address_space_operations] using
  `inode->i_mapping->a_ops` or alternatively `page->mapping->a_ops`.

* When normal file operations are taking place such as `mmap()`, [read()][read]
  and [write()][write], the [struct file_operations][file_operations] with the
  appropriate functions is found using `inode->i_fop`. The diagram shown in 4.2
  goes into more detail.

* The interface is nice and clean and is conceptually easy to understand, but it
  does not help _anonymous_ pages as there is no file backing there.

* To keep this nice interface, linux creates an artificial file backing for
  anonymous pages using a RAM-based filesystem where each VMA is backed by a
  file in this filesystem.

* Every inode in the artificial filesystem is placed on a linked list,
  [shmem_inodes][shmem_inodes], so they can be easily located.

* Overall this approach allows the same file-based interface to be used without
  treating anonymous pages as a special case.

* The filesystem comes in two variations in 2.4.22 - `shm` and `tmpfs`. They
  share core functionality and mainly different in what they're used for - `shm`
  is used by the kernel for creating file backings for anonymous pages and for
  backing regions created by [shmget()][shmget], the filesystem is mounted by
  [kern_mount()][kern_mount] so it's mounted internally and isn't visible to
  users.

* `tmpfs` is a temporary file system that is often mounted at `/tmp` publicly as
  as fast RAM-based temp fs. A secondary use for tmpfs is to mount `/tmp/shm`
  which allows [mmap()][mmap]-ing of files there in order to share information
  as a form of [IPC][ipc]. Regardless of the type of use, a sysadmin has to
  explicitly mount the tmpfs.

## 12.1 Initialising the Virtual Filesystem

* The virtual filesystem is initialised by [init_tmpfs()][init_tmpfs] either
  during system start or when the module is being loaded. This does the
  following:

1. Mounts `tmpfs` and `shm`, with `shm` mounted internally via
   [kern_mount()][kern_mount].

2. Calculates the maximum number of blocks and inodes that can exist in the
   filesystem.

3. As part of the registration, the function
   [shmem_read_super()][shmem_read_super] is used as a callback to populate a
   [struct super_block][super_block] with more information about the
   filesystems, such as making the block size equal to the page size.

* Every inode created in the filesystem will have a
  [struct shmem_inode_info][shmem_inode_info] associated with it containing
  private information specific to the filesystem.

* [SHMEM_I()][SHMEM_I] takes an inode as a parameter and returns a pointer to a
  `struct shmem_inode_info`, bridging the gap between the two. Taking a look at
  the latter:

```c
struct shmem_inode_info {
        spinlock_t              lock;
        unsigned long           next_index;
        swp_entry_t             i_direct[SHMEM_NR_DIRECT]; /* for the first blocks */
        void                    **i_indirect; /* indirect blocks */
        unsigned long           swapped;    /* data pages assigned to swap */
        unsigned long           flags;
        struct list_head        list;
        struct inode            *inode;
};
```

* Considered each field:

1. `lock` - Spinlock protecting the inode information from concurrent accesses.

2. `next_index` - Index of the last page being used in the file. This will be
   different from `inode->i_size` when a file is being truncated.

3. `i_direct` - direct block containing the first
   [SHMEM_NR_DIRECT][SHMEM_NR_DIRECT] swap vectors in use by the file (see
   12.4.1.)

4. `i_indirect` - Pointer to the first indirect block (see 12.4.1.)

5. `swapped` - Count of the number of pages belonging to the file that are

   currently swapped out.

6. `flags` - Currently only used to determine if the file belongs to shared
   region set by [shmget()][shmget]. It is set by specifying `SHM_LOCK` when
   calling `shmget()` and unlocked via `SHM_UNLOCK`.

7. `list` - List of all inodes used by the filesystem.

8. `inode` - Pointer to the parent inode.

## 12.2 Using shmem Functions

* Different structs contain pointers for `shmem`-specific functions. Regardless,
  in all cases `tmpfs` and `shm` share the same structs.

* For faulting in pages and writing them to backing storage, two structs - a
  [struct address_space_operations][address_space_operations],
  [shmem_aops][shmem_aops] and a
  [struct vm_operations_struct][vm_operations_struct],
  [shmem_vm_ops][shmem_vm_ops].

* Taking a look at the address space operations struct `shmem_aops`:

```c
static struct address_space_operations shmem_aops = {
        removepage:     shmem_removepage,
        writepage:      shmem_writepage,
#ifdef CONFIG_TMPFS
        readpage:       shmem_readpage,
        prepare_write:  shmem_prepare_write,
        commit_write:   shmem_commit_write,
#endif
};
```

* The most important function referenced here is
  [shmem_writepage()][shmem_writepage], which is called when a page is moved
  from the page cache to the swap cache.

* [shmem_removepage()][shmem_removepage] is called when apage is removed from
  the page cache so that the block can be reclaimed.

* [shmem_readpage()][shmem_readpage] is not used by `tmpfs`, but is provided so
  the [sendfile()][sendfile] system call can be used with tmpfs files.

* Similarly, [shmem_prepare_write()][shmem_prepare_write] and
  [shmem_commit_write()][shmem_commit_write] are also unused, but provided so
  that `tmpfs` can be used with with the loopback device.

* Taking a look at [struct shmem_vm_ops][shmem_vm_ops]:

```c
static struct vm_operations_struct shmem_vm_ops = {
        nopage:         shmem_nopage,
};
```

* `shmem_vm_ops` is used by anonymous VMAs as their
  [struct vm_operations_struct][vm_operations_struct] so that
  [shmem_nopage()][shmem_nopage] is called when a new page is faulted in.

* To perform operations on files and inodes a
  [struct file_operations][file_operations] and a
  [struct inode_operations][inode_operations] are required. The former is
  provided as [shmem_file_operations][shmem_file_operations]:

```c
static struct file_operations shmem_file_operations = {
        mmap:           shmem_mmap,
#ifdef CONFIG_TMPFS
        read:           shmem_file_read,
        write:          shmem_file_write,
        fsync:          shmem_sync_file,
#endif
};
```

* Three sets of `struct inode_operations` are provided -
  [shmem_inode_operations][shmem_inode_operations],
  [shmem_dir_inode_operations][shmem_dir_inode_operations], and a related pair -
  [shmem_symlink_inline_operations][shmem_symlink_inline_operations] [shmem_symlink_inode_operations][shmem_symlink_inode_operations] for handling
  file inodes, directory inodes and symlink inodes respectively.

* The two file operations supported are `truncate()` and `setattr()`:

```c
static struct inode_operations shmem_inode_operations = {
        truncate:        shmem_truncate,
        setattr:        shmem_notify_change,
};
```

* [shmem_truncate()][shmem_truncate] is used to truncate a file. since
  [shmem_notify_change()][shmem_notify_change] is called when file attributes
  change it's possible (amongst other things) for a file to be grown with
  `truncate()` and to use the global zero page as the data page.

* The directory [struct inode_operations][inode_operations] provides a number of
  functions:

```c
static struct inode_operations shmem_dir_inode_operations = {
#ifdef CONFIG_TMPFS
        create:         shmem_create,
        lookup:         shmem_lookup,
        link:           shmem_link,
        unlink:         shmem_unlink,
        symlink:        shmem_symlink,
        mkdir:          shmem_mkdir,
        rmdir:          shmem_rmdir,
        mknod:          shmem_mknod,
        rename:         shmem_rename,
#endif
};
```

* Finally we have the pair of symlink `struct inode_operations`s:

```c
static struct inode_operations shmem_symlink_inline_operations = {
        readlink:       shmem_readlink_inline,
        follow_link:    shmem_follow_link_inline,
};

static struct inode_operations shmem_symlink_inode_operations = {
        truncate:       shmem_truncate,
        readlink:       shmem_readlink,
        follow_link:    shmem_follow_link,
};
```

* The difference between the two `readlink()` and `follow_link()` functions is
  related to where the information is stored. A symlink inode does not require
  the private inode information stored in a
  [struct shmem_inode_info][shmem_inode_info].

* If the length of the symbolic link name is smaller than a `struct
  shmem_inode_info`, the space in the inode is used to store the name and
  [shmem_symlink_inline_operations][shmem_symlink_inline_operations] becomes the
  relevant [struct inode_operations][inode_operations] struct.

* Otherwise, a page is allocated via [shmem_getpage()][shmem_getpage], the
  symbolic link is copied to it and
  [shmem_symlink_inode_operations][shmem_symlink_inode_operations] is used.

* The inode symlink struct contains a `truncate()` function so the page will be
  reclaimed when the file is deleted.

* These structs ensure that the shmem equivalent of inode-related operations
  will be used when regions are backed by virtual files. The majority of the VM
  sees no difference between pages backed by a real file and those backed by
  virtual files.
