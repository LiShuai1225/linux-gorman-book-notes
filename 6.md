# Chapter 6: Physical Page Allocation

* Physical pages are managed using the 'binary buddy allocator', originally
  devised by Knowlton and further described by Knuth (TAocP Volume 1, Section
  2.5, pg. 442) and has shown to be extremely fast compared to other allocators
  (see David G. Korn and Kiem-Phong Bo. In search of a better malloc In
  Proceedings of the Summer 1985 USENIX Conference, pages 489â€“506, Portland, OR,
  1985.)

* This is an allocation scheme that combines a power-or-two allocator with free
  buffer coalescing.

* The concept behind a binary buddy allocator is quite simple:

1. Memory is broken up into large blocks of pages where each block is a power
   of 2 number of pages.

2. If a block of the desired size is not available a large block is broken up in
   half and the two blocks are considered 'buddies' to each other - one half is
   used for the allocation, the other is free.

3. The blocks are continuously halved as necessary until a block of the desired
   size is available.

4. When a block is freed the buddy is examined, and the two are coalesced if it
   is free.
