# Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager

This is a set of notes I am amateurishly extracting from the book
[Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager][amazon] written by esteemed
[Mel Gorman][mel].

These are written for my own tastes and understanding so will likely not be
useful for anybody else, but I am placing them here primarily as a record for
myself, though if others find them somehow useful (2.4.22 fetishists perhaps? ;)
then that's great too!

[The book][book] is licensed under an [Open Publication License][license] with
the options "no substantial derivitives" and "no distribution for commercial
purposes".

Though this is a (substantial) derivative, it is entirely without commercial aim
of course, and designed merely as a study guide for myself.
