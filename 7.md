# Chapter 7: Non-contiguous Memory Allocation

* When dealing with large amounts of memory it is better if possible to use
  physically contiguous pages both in terms of caching and memory access latency.

* Unfortunately this is not always possible due to external fragmentation
  problems with the binary buddy allocator (LS - I thought internal
  fragmentation was more the problem for the binary buddy system? Also is this
  the only cause of non-contiguous pages?)

* Linux provides a means for non-contiguous physical memory to be used in
  contiguous virtual memory via [vmalloc()][vmalloc].

* When `vmalloc()` is used, an area is reserved in the virtual address space
  between [VMALLOC_START][VMALLOC_START] and [VMALLOC_END][VMALLOC_END] - the
  location of `VMALLOC_START` varies depending on the amount of available
  physical memory, but the region will be at least
  [VMALLOC_RESERVE][VMALLOC_RESERVE] (aliased to
  [__VMALLOC_RESERVE][__VMALLOC_RESERVE]) in size, which on i386 is 128MiB - the
  exact size of the region was discussed in more detail in section 4.1

* The page tables in this region are adjusted as needed to point to physical
  pages which are allocated with the normal physical page allocator - this means
  that allocation _has_ to be a multiple of the hardware page size.

* Because performing allocations this way require modifications to be made to
  the kernel page tables, there is a limitation on how much memory can be mapped
  with `vmalloc()` because only the virtual address space between
  `VMALLOC_START` and `VMALLOC_END` is available.

* Because of the limited nature of `vmalloc()`, it is used sparingly in the core
  kernel - in fact in 2.4.22 it is only used for storing swap map information
  (see chapter 11) and for loading kernel modules into memory.
