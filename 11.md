# Chapter 11: Swap Management

* Just as linux uses free memory for buffering data from a disk, the reverse is
  true as well - eventually there's a need to free up private or anonymous pages
  used by a process. The pages are copied to backing storage, sometimes called
  the 'swap area'.

* Strictly speaking, linux doesn't swap because 'swapping' refers to copying an
  entire process address space to disk and 'paging' to copying out individual
  pages, however it's referred to as 'swapping' in discussion and documentation
  so we'll call it swapping regardless.

* There are 2 principal reasons for the existence of swap space:

1. It expands the amount of memory a process may use - virtual memory and swap
   space allows a large process to run even if the process is only partially
   resident. Because old pages may be swapped out, the amount of memory
   addressed may easily exceed RAM because demand paging will ensure the pages
   are reloaded if necessary.

2. Even if sufficient memory, swap is useful - a significant number of pages
   referenced by a process early on in its life may only be used for
   initialisation then never used again. It's better to swap out these pages and
   create more disk buffers than leave them resident and unused.

* Swap is slow. Very slow as disks are slow (relatively to memory) - if
  processes are _frequently_ addressing a large amount of memory no amount of
  swap or fast disks will make it run without a reasonable time, only more RAM
  can help.

* It's very important that the correct page be swapped out (as discussed in
  chapter 10), and also that related pages be stored close together in the swap
  space so they are likely to be swapped in at the same time while reading
  ahead.
