# Chapter 11: Swap Management

* Just as linux uses free memory for buffering data from a disk, the reverse is
  true as well - eventually there's a need to free up private or anonymous pages
  used by a process. The pages are copied to backing storage, sometimes called
  the 'swap area'.

* Strictly speaking, linux doesn't swap because 'swapping' refers to copying an
  entire process address space to disk and 'paging' to copying out individual
  pages, however it's referred to as 'swapping' in discussion and documentation
  so we'll call it swapping regardless.

* There are 2 principal reasons for the existence of swap space:

1. It expands the amount of memory a process may use - virtual memory and swap
   space allows a large process to run even if the process is only partially
   resident. Because old pages may be swapped out, the amount of memory
   addressed may easily exceed RAM because demand paging will ensure the pages
   are reloaded if necessary.

2. Even if sufficient memory, swap is useful - a significant number of pages
   referenced by a process early on in its life may only be used for
   initialisation then never used again. It's better to swap out these pages and
   create more disk buffers than leave them resident and unused.

* Swap is slow. Very slow as disks are slow (relatively to memory) - if
  processes are _frequently_ addressing a large amount of memory no amount of
  swap or fast disks will make it run without a reasonable time, only more RAM
  can help.

* It's very important that the correct page be swapped out (as discussed in
  chapter 10), and also that related pages be stored close together in the swap
  space so they are likely to be swapped in at the same time while reading
  ahead.

## 11.1 Describing the Swap Area

* Each active swap area has a [struct swap_info_struct][swap_info_struct]
  describing the area:

```c
/*
 * The in-memory structure used to track swap areas.
 */
struct swap_info_struct {
        unsigned int flags;
        kdev_t swap_device;
        spinlock_t sdev_lock;
        struct dentry * swap_file;
        struct vfsmount *swap_vfsmnt;
        unsigned short * swap_map;
        unsigned int lowest_bit;
        unsigned int highest_bit;
        unsigned int cluster_next;
        unsigned int cluster_nr;
        int prio;                       /* swap priority */
        int pages;
        unsigned long max;
        int next;                       /* next entry on swap list */
};
```

* All the `swap_info_struct`s in the running system are stored in a statically
  declared array, [swap_info][swap_info] which holds
  [MAX_SWAPFILES][MAX_SWAPFILES] (defined as 32) - this means that at most 32
  swap areas can exist on a running system.

* Looking at each field:

1. `flags` - A bit field with 2 possible values - [SWP_USED][SWP_USED] (`0b01`)
   and [SWP_WRITEOK][SWP_WRITEOK] (`0b11`). `SWP_USED` implies the swap area is
   currently active, and `SWP_WRITEOK` when linux is ready to write to the
   area. `SWP_WRITEOK` contains `SWP_USED` as the former implies the latter must
   be the case.

2. `swap_device` - The device corresponding to the partition for this swap
   area. If the swap area is a file, this is set to `NULL`.

3. `sdev_lock` - - Spinlock protecting the struct, most pertinently
   `swap_map`. It's locked and unlocked via
   [swap_device_lock()][swap_device_lock] and
   [swap_device_unlock()][swap_device_unlock].

4. `swap_file` - The [struct dentry][dentry] for the actual special file that is
   mounted as a swap area, for example this file may exist in `/dev` in the case
   that a partition is mounted. This field is needed to identify the correct
   `swap_info_struct` when deactivating a swap area.

5. `swap_vfsmnt` - The [struct vfsmount][vfsmount] object corresponding to where
   the device or file for this swap area is located.

6. `swap_map` - A large array containing one entry for every swap entry or
   page-sized slot in the area. An 'entry' is a reference count of the number of
   users of the page slot, with the swap cache counting as one user and every
   PTE that has been paged out to the slot as the other users. If the entry is
   equal to [SWAP_MAP_MAX][SWAP_MAP_MAX], the slot is allocated permanently. If
   it's equal to [SWAP_MAP_BAD][SWAP_MAP_BAD], the slot will never be used.

7. `lowest_bit` - Lowest possible free slot available in the swap area and is
   used to start from when linearly scanning to reduce the search space - there
   are definitely no free slots below this mark.

8. `highest_bit` - Highest possible free slot available. Similar to
   `lowest_bit`, there are definitely no free slots above this mark.

9. `cluster_next` - Offset of the next cluster of blocks to use. The swap area
   tries to have pages allocated in cluster blocks to increase the chance
   related pages will be stored together.

10. `cluster_nr` - Number of pages left to allocate in this cluster.

11. `prio` - The 'priority' of the swap area - this determines how likely the
    area is to be used. By default the priorities are arranged in order of
    activation, but the sysadmin may also specify it using the `-p` flag of
    [swapon][swapon].

12. `pages` - Because some slots on the swap file may be unusable, this field
    stores the number of usable pages in the swap area. This differs from `max`
    in that swaps marked [SWAP_MAP_BAD][SWAP_MAP_BAD] are not counted.

13. `max` - Total number of slots in this swap area.

14. `next` - The index in the [swap_info][swap_info] array of the next swap area
    in the system.

* The areas are not only stored in an array, they are also kept in a
  [struct swap_list_t][swap_list_t] 'pseudolist'
  [swap_list][swap_list]. `swap_list_t` is a simple type:

```c
struct swap_list_t {
        int head;       /* head of priority-ordered swapfile list */
        int next;       /* swapfile to be used next */
};
```

* `head` is the index of the swap area of the highest priority swap area in use,
  and `next` is the index of the next swap area that should be used.

* This list enables areas to be looked up in order of priority when necessary
  but still remain easily looked up in the `swap_info` array.

* Each swap area is divided into a number of page-sized slots on disk (e.g. 4KiB
  each on i386.)

* The first slot is always reserved because it contains information about the
  swap area that must not be overwritten, including the first 1KiB which stores
  a disk label for the partition that can be retrieved via userspace tools.

* The remaining space in this initial slot is used for information about the
  swap area which is filled when the swap area is created with
  [mkswap][mkswap]. This is represented by the [union swap_header][swap_header]
  union:

```c
/*
 * Magic header for a swap area. The first part of the union is
 * what the swap magic looks like for the old (limited to 128MB)
 * swap area format, the second part of the union adds - in the
 * old reserved area - some extra information. Note that the first
 * kilobyte is reserved for boot loader or disk label stuff...
 *
 * Having the magic at the end of the PAGE_SIZE makes detecting swap
 * areas somewhat tricky on machines that support multiple page sizes.
 * For 2.5 we'll probably want to move the magic to just beyond the
 * bootbits...
 */
union swap_header {
        struct
        {
                char reserved[PAGE_SIZE - 10];
                char magic[10];                 /* SWAP-SPACE or SWAPSPACE2 */
        } magic;
        struct
        {
                char         bootbits[1024];    /* Space for disklabel etc. */
                unsigned int version;
                unsigned int last_page;
                unsigned int nr_badpages;
                unsigned int padding[125];
                unsigned int badpages[1];
        } info;
};
```

* Looking at each of the fields:

1. `reserved` - Dummy field used to position `magic` correctly at the end of the
   page.

2. `magic` - Used for identifying the magic string that identifies a swap
   header - this is in place to ensure that a partition that is not a swap area
   will never be used by mistake, and to determine what version of swap area is
   to be used - if the string is `"SWAP-SPACE"`, then it's version 1 of the swap
   file format. If it's `"SWAPSPACE2"`, then version 2 will be used.

3. `bootbits` - Reserved area containing information about the partition such as
   the disk label, retrievable via userspace tools.

4. `version` - Version of the swap area layout.

5. `last_page` - Last usable page in the area.

6. `nr_badpages` - Known number of bad pages that exist in the swap area.

7. `padding` - Disk sectors are usually 512 bytes in size. `version`,
   `last_page` and `nr_badpages` take up 12 bytes, so this field takes up the
   remaining 500 bytes to sector-align `badpages`.

8. `badpages` - The remainder of the page is used to store the indices of up to
   [MAX_SWAP_BADPAGES][MAX_SWAP_BADPAGES] number of bad page slots. These are
   filled in by the [mkswap][mkswap] userland tool if the `-c` switch is
   specified to check the area.

* `MAX_SWAP_BADPAGES` is a compile-time constant that varies if the struct
  changes, but is 637 entries in its current form determined by:

```
MAX_SWAP_BADPAGES = (PAGE_SIZE - <bootblock size = 1024> - <padding size = 512> -
                     <magic string size = 10>)/sizeof(long)
```

## 11.2 Mapping Page Table Entries to Swap Entries

* When a page is swapped out, linux uses the corresponding PTE to store enough
  information to locate the page on disk again. Rather than storing the physical
  address of the page, the PTE contains this information and has the appropriate
  flags set to indicate that it is not an address.

* Clearly, a PTE is not large enough to store precisely where on the disk the
  page is located, but it's more than enough to store an index into the
  [swap_info][swap_info] array and an offset within the `swap_map`.

* Each PTE, regardless of architecture, is large enough to store a
  [swp_entry_t][swp_entry_t]:

```c
/*
 * A swap entry has to fit into a "unsigned long", as
 * the entry is hidden in the "index" field of the
 * swapper address space.
 *
 * We have to move it here, since not every user of fs.h is including
 * mm.h, but mm.h is including fs.h via sched .h :-/
 */
typedef struct {
        unsigned long val;
} swp_entry_t;
```

* [pte_to_swp_entry()][pte_to_swp_entry] and
  [swp_entry_to_pte()][swp_entry_to_pte] are used to translate between PTEs and
  swap entries.

* As always we'll focus on i386, however all architectures has to be able to
  determine if a PTE is present or swapped out. In the `swp_entry_t` two bits
  are always kept free - on i386 bit 0 is reserved for the
  [_PAGE_PRESENT][_PAGE_PRESENT] flag and bit 7 is reserved for
  [_PAGE_PROTNONE][_PAGE_PROTNONE] (both discussed in 3.2.)

* Bits 1 to 6 are used for the 'type' which is the index within the
  [swap_info][swap_info] array and is returned via [SWP_TYPE()][SWP_TYPE].

* Bits 8 through 31 (base-0 so all remaining bits) are used to the the _offset_
  within the `swap_map` from the `swp_entry_t`. This means there are 24 bits
  available, limiting the swap area to 64GiB (`2^24 * 4096` bytes.)

* The offset is extracted via [SWP_OFFSET()][SWP_OFFSET]. To encode a type and
  offset into a [swp_entry_t][swp_entry_t], [SWP_ENTRY()][SWP_ENTRY] is
  available which does all needed bit-shifting.

* Looking at the relationship between the various macros diagrammatically:

```
       -------          ---------- --------
       | PTE |          | Offset | | Type |
       -------          ---------- --------

                        | SWP_OFFSET() |             | SWP_TYPE() |
                        ----------------             --------------
                                |                           |
                                |                           |
                                v                           v
                           ----------                   --------
                           | Offset |                   | Type |
                           ----------                   --------
```

* The six bits for type should allow up to 64 (2^6) swap areas to exist in a
  32-bit architecture, however [MAX_SWAPFILES][MAX_SWAPFILES] is set at 32. This
  is due to the consumption of the `vmalloc` address space (see chapter 7 for
  more on vmalloc.)

* If a swap area is the maximum possible size, 32MiB is required for the
  `swap_map` (`2^24 * sizeof(short)`) - remembering that each page uses one
  `short` for the reference count. This means that if `MAX_SWAPFILES = 32` swaps
  exist, 1GiB of virtual malloc space is required, which is simply impossible
  given the user/kernel linear address space split.

* You'd think this would mean that supporting 64 swap areas is not worth the
  additional complexity, but this is not the case - if a system has multiple
  disks, it's worth having this complexity in order to distribute swap across
  all disks to allow for maximal parallelism and hence performance.

## 11.3 Allocating a Swap Slot

* As discussed previously, all page-sized slots are tracked by the
  [struct swap_info][swap_info]`->swap_map` `unsigned short` array each of which
  act as a reference count (number of 'users' of the slot, with the swap cache
  acting as the first 'user' - a shared page can have a lot of these of course.)

* If the entry is [SWAP_MAP_MAX][SWAP_MAP_MAX] the page is permanently reserved
  for that slot. This is unlikely but not impossible - it's designed to ensure
  the reference count does not overflow.

* If the entry is [SWAP_MAP_BAD][SWAP_MAP_BAD], the slot is unusable.

* Finding and allocating a swap entry is divided into two major tasks -
  the first is performed by [get_swap_page()][get_swap_page]:

1. Starting with [swap_list][swap_list]`->next`, search swap areas for a
   suitable slot.

2. Once a slot has been found, record what the next swap to be used will be and
   return the allocated entry.

* The second major task is is the searching itself, which is performed by
  [scan_swap_map()][scan_swap_map]. In principle it's very simple because it
  linearly scans the array for a free slot, however the implementation is little
  more involved than that:

```c
static inline int scan_swap_map(struct swap_info_struct *si)
{
        unsigned long offset;
        /*
         * We try to cluster swap pages by allocating them
         * sequentially in swap.  Once we've allocated
         * SWAPFILE_CLUSTER pages this way, however, we resort to
         * first-free allocation, starting a new cluster.  This
         * prevents us from scattering swap pages all over the entire
         * swap partition, so that we reduce overall disk seek times
         * between swap pages.  -- sct */
        if (si->cluster_nr) {
                while (si->cluster_next <= si->highest_bit) {
                        offset = si->cluster_next++;
                        if (si->swap_map[offset])
                                continue;
                        si->cluster_nr--;
                        goto got_page;
                }
        }
        si->cluster_nr = SWAPFILE_CLUSTER;

        /* try to find an empty (even not aligned) cluster. */
        offset = si->lowest_bit;
 check_next_cluster:
        if (offset+SWAPFILE_CLUSTER-1 <= si->highest_bit)
        {
                int nr;
                for (nr = offset; nr < offset+SWAPFILE_CLUSTER; nr++)
                        if (si->swap_map[nr])
                        {
                                offset = nr+1;
                                goto check_next_cluster;
                        }
                /* We found a completly empty cluster, so start
                 * using it.
                 */
                goto got_page;
        }
        /* No luck, so now go finegrined as usual. -Andrea */
        for (offset = si->lowest_bit; offset <= si->highest_bit ; offset++) {
                if (si->swap_map[offset])
                        continue;
                si->lowest_bit = offset+1;
        got_page:
                if (offset == si->lowest_bit)
                        si->lowest_bit++;
                if (offset == si->highest_bit)
                        si->highest_bit--;
                if (si->lowest_bit > si->highest_bit) {
                        si->lowest_bit = si->max;
                        si->highest_bit = 0;
                }
                si->swap_map[offset] = 1;
                nr_swap_pages--;
                si->cluster_next = offset+1;
                return offset;
        }
        si->lowest_bit = si->max;
        si->highest_bit = 0;
        return 0;
}
```

* Linux tries to organise pages into 'clusters' on disk of size
  [SWAPFILE_CLUSTER][SWAPFILE_CLUSTER]. It allocates `SWAPFILE_CLUSTER` pages
  sequentially in swap, keeps count of the number of sequentially allocated
  pages in [struct swap_info_struct][swap_info_struct]`->cluster_nr` and records
  the current offset in `swap_info_struct->cluster_next`.

* After a sequential block has been allocated, it searches for a block of free
  entries of size [SWAPFILE_CLUSTER][SWAPFILE_CLUSTER]. If a large enough block
  can be found, it will be used as another cluster-sized sequence.

* If no free clusters large enough can be found in the swap area, a simple
  first-free search is performed starting from `swap_info_struct->lowest_bit`.

* The aim is to have pages swapped out at the same time close together, on the
  premise that pages swapped out together are likely to be related. This makes
  sense because the page replacement algorithm will use swap space most when
  linearly scanning the process address space.

* Without scanning for large free blocks and using them, it is likely the
  scanning would degenerate to first-free searches and never improve, with it
  exiting processes are likely to free up large blocks of slots.

## 11.4 Swap Cache

* Pages that are shared between many processes cannot be easily swapped out
  because there's no quick way to map a [struct page][page] to every PTE that
  references it.

* If special care wasn't taken this fact could lead to the rare condition where
  a page that is present for one PTE and swapped out for another gets updated
  without being synced to disk, thereby losing the update.

* To address the problem, shared pages that have a reserved slot in backing
  storage are considered to be part of the 'swap cache'.

* The swap cache is simply a specialisation of the page cache with the main
  difference between pages in the swap cache and the page cache being that pages
  in the swap cache always use [swapper_space][swapper_space] as their
  [struct address_space][address_space] in `page->mapping`.

* Another difference is that pages are added to the swap cache with
  [add_to_swap_cache()][add_to_swap_cache] instead of
  [add_to_page_cache()][add_to_page_cache].

* Taking a look at the swap cache API:

1. [get_swap_page()][get_swap_page] - Allocates a slot in a `swap_map` by
   searching active swap areas. Covered in more detail in 11.3.

2. [add_to_swap_cache()][add_to_swap_cache] - Adds a page to the swap cache -
   first checking to see whether it already exists by calling `swap_duplicate()`
   and if not adding it to the swap cache via
   [add_to_page_cache_unique()][add_to_page_cache_unique].

3. [lookup_swap_cache()][lookup_swap_cache] - Searches the swap cache and
   returns the [struct page][page] corresponding to the specified swap entry. It
   works by searching the normal page cache based on
   [swapper_space][swapper_space] and the `swap_map` offset.

4. [swap_duplicate()][swap_duplicate] - Verifies a swap entry is valid, and if
   so, increments its swap map count.

5. [swap_free()][swap_free] - The complement to `swap_duplicate()`. Decrements
   the relevant counter in the `swap_map`. Once this count reaches zero, the
   slot is effectively free.

* Anonymous pages are not part of the swap cache until an attempt is made to
  swap them out.

* Taking a look at [swapper_space][swapper_space]:

```c
struct address_space swapper_space = {
        LIST_HEAD_INIT(swapper_space.clean_pages),
        LIST_HEAD_INIT(swapper_space.dirty_pages),
        LIST_HEAD_INIT(swapper_space.locked_pages),
        0,                              /* nrpages      */
        &swap_aops,
};
```

* A page is defined as being part of the swap cache when its
  [struct page][page]`->mapping` field has been set to `swapper_space`. This is
  determined by [PageSwapCache()][PageSwapCache].

* Linux uses the exact same code for keeping pages between swap and memory sync
  as it uses for keeping file-backed pages and memory in sync - they both share
  the page cache code, the differences being in the functions used.

* The address space for backing storage, `swapper_space`, uses
  [swap_aops][swap_aops] in its [struct address_space][address_space]`->a_ops`.

* The `page->index` field is then used to store the [swp_entry_t][swp_entry_t]
  structure instead of a file offset (its usual purpose.)

* The [struct address_space_operations][address_space_operations] struct
  `swap_aops` is defined as follows, using [swap_writepage()][swap_writepage]
  and [block_sync_page()][block_sync_page]:

```c
static struct address_space_operations swap_aops = {
        writepage: swap_writepage,
        sync_page: block_sync_page,
};
```

* When a page is being added to the swap cache, a slot is allocated with
  [get_swap_page()][get_swap_page], added to the page cache with
  [add_to_swap_cache()][add_to_swap_cache] and then marked dirty.

* When the page is next laundered, it will actually be written to backing
  storage on disk as the normal page cache would operate. Diagrammatically:

```

* Subsequent swapping of the page from shared PTEs results in a call to
  [swap_duplicate()][swap_duplicate] which simply increments the reference to
  the slot in the `swap_map`.

* If the PTE is marked dirty by the hardware as the result of a write, the bit
  is cleared and its [struct page][page] is marked dirty via
  [set_page_dirty()][set_page_dirty] so the on-disk copy will be synced before
  the page is dropped. This ensures that until all references to a page have
  been dropped, a check will be made to ensure the data on disk matches the data
  in the page frame.

* When the reference count to the page reaches 0, the page is eligible to be
  dropped from the page cache and the swap map count will equal the count of the
  number of PTEs the on-disk slot belongs to so the slot won't be freed
  prematurely. It is laundered then finally dropped with the same LRU ageing and
  logic described in chapter 10.

* If, on the other hand, a page fault occurs for a page that is swapped out,
  [do_swap_page()][do_swap_page] checks to see if the page exists in the swap
  cache by calling [lookup_swap_cache()][lookup_swap_cache] - if it exists, the
  PTE is updated to point to the page frame, the page reference count is
  incremented and the swap slot is decremented with [swap_free()][swap_free].

## 11.5 Reading Pages From Backing Storage

* The principal function used for reading in pages is
  [read_swap_cache_async()][read_swap_cache_async] which is mainly called during
  page faulting:

```c
/*
 * Locate a page of swap in physical memory, reserving swap cache space
 * and reading the disk if it is not already cached.
 * A failure return means that either the page allocation failed or that
 * the swap entry is no longer in use.
 */
struct page * read_swap_cache_async(swp_entry_t entry)
{
        struct page *found_page, *new_page = NULL;
        int err;

        do {
                /*
                 * First check the swap cache.  Since this is normally
                 * called after lookup_swap_cache() failed, re-calling
                 * that would confuse statistics: use find_get_page()
                 * directly.
                 */
                found_page = find_get_page(&swapper_space, entry.val);
                if (found_page)
                        break;

                /*
                 * Get a new page to read into from swap.
                 */
                if (!new_page) {
                        new_page = alloc_page(GFP_HIGHUSER);
                        if (!new_page)
                                break;          /* Out of memory */
                }

                /*
                 * Associate the page with swap entry in the swap cache.
                 * May fail (-ENOENT) if swap entry has been freed since
                 * our caller observed it.  May fail (-EEXIST) if there
                 * is already a page associated with this entry in the
                 * swap cache: added by a racing read_swap_cache_async,
                 * or by try_to_swap_out (or shmem_writepage) re-using
                 * the just freed swap entry for an existing page.
                 */
                err = add_to_swap_cache(new_page, entry);
                if (!err) {
                        /*
                         * Initiate read into locked page and return.
                         */
                        rw_swap_page(READ, new_page);
                        return new_page;
                }
        } while (err != -ENOENT);

        if (new_page)
                page_cache_release(new_page);
        return found_page;
}
```

* This does the following:

1. The function starts by searching the swap cache via
   [find_get_page()][find_get_page]. It doesn't use the usual
   [lookup_swap_cache()][lookup_swap_cache] swap cache search function as that
   updates statistics on number of searches performed however we are likely to
   search multiple times so `find_get_page()` makes more sense here.

2. If the page isn't already in the swap cache, allocate one using
   [alloc_page()][alloc_page] and add it to swap cache using
   [add_to_swap_cache()][add_to_swap_cache]. If, however, a page _is_ found,
   skip to step 5.

3. If the page cannot be added to the swap cache, it'll be searched again in
   case another process put the data there in the meantime.

4. The data is read from backing storage via [rw_swap_page()][rw_swap_page]
   (discussed in 11.7), and returned to the user.

5. If the page was found in the cache and _didn't_ need
   allocating,[page_cache_release()][page_cache_release] is called to decrement
   the reference count accumulated via `find_get_page()`.

## 11.6 Writing Pages to Backing Storage

* When any page is being written to disk the
  [struct address_space][address_space]`->a_ops` field is used to determine the
  appropriate 'write-out' function.

* In the case of backing storage, the `address_space` is
  [swapper_space][swapper_space] and the swap operations are contained in
  [swap_aops][swap_aops] which uses [swap_writepage()][swap_writepage] for its
  write-out function.

* `swap_writepage()` behaves differently depending on whether the writing
  process is the last user of the swap cache page or not - it determines this
  via [remove_exclusive_swap_page()][remove_exclusive_swap_page] which simply
  checks the page count with [pagecache_lock][pagecache_lock] held - if no other
  process is mapping the page it is removed from the swap cache and freed.

* If `remove_exclusive_swap_page()` removed the page from the swap cache and
  freed it, [swap_writepage()][swap_writepage] unlocks the page because it is no
  longer in use.

* If the page still exists in the swap cache, [rw_swap_page()][rw_swap_page] is
  called which writes the data to the backing storage.
