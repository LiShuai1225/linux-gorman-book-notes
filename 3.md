# Chapter 3: Page Table Management

* Linux has a unique means of abstracting the architecture-specific details of
  physical pages. It maintains a concept of a three-level page table (note: this
  is relevant to 2.4.22 of course, in later kernels it is [4 levels][4level].)
  The 3 levels are:

1. Page Global Directory (PGD)

2. Page Middle Directory (PMD)

3. Page Table Entry (PTE)

* This three-level page table structure is implemented _even if_ the underlying
  architecture does not support it.

* Though this is conceptually easy to understand, it means the distinction
  between different types of pages is really blurry, and page types are
  identified by their flags or what lists they reside in rather than the objects
  they belong to.

* Architectures that manage their [Memory Management Unit (MMU)][mmu]
  differently are expected to emulate the three-level page tables. E.g. on x86
  without PAE, only two page table levels are available, so the PMD is defined
  to be of size 1 and 'folds back' directly onto the PGD, and this is optimised
  out at compile time.

* For architectures that do not manage their cache or
  [Translation lookaside buffer (TLB)][tlb] automatically,
  architecture-dependent hooks have to be left in the code for when the TLB and
  CPU caches need to be altered and flushed, even if they are null operations on
  some architectures like the x86 (discussed further in section 3.8.)

## 3.1 Describing the Page Directory

* Each process has a pointer [mm_struct][mm_struct]`->pgd` to its own PGD, which
  is a physical page frame containing an array of type [pgd_t][pgd_t], an
  architecture specific type defined in `asm/page.h`.

* Page tables are loaded differently depending on architecture. On x86, process
  page table is loaded by copying `mm_struct->pgd` into the `cr3` register,
  which has the side effect of flushing the TLB.

* In fact, on x86, [__flush_tlb()][__flush_tlb] is implemented by copying `cr3`
  into a temporary register, then copying that result back in again.

* Each _active_ entry in the PGD table points to a page frame (i.e. physical
  page of memory) containing an array of PMD entries of type [pmd_t][pmd_t],
  which in term point to page frames containing PTEs of type [pte_t][pte_t],
  which finally point to page frames containing the actual user data.
