# Chapter 5: Boot Memory Allocator

* It's just not practical to statically initialise all the core kernel memory
  structures at compile-time, because there are too many permutations of
  hardware configurations out there.

* To set up even the most basic structures requires memory - even the physical
  page allocator needs to allocate memory to initialise itself. But how?

* To get around this issue, a specialised allocator called the 'boot memory
  allocator' is used.

* It uses the most basic allocator algorithm - [first fit][first-fit]. This
  means the first available space that can store the requested amount of memory
  is used.

* Additionally the allocator uses a bitmap to represent memory rather than
  linked lists of free blocks. If a bit is 1, the page is allocated, if it is 0,
  it is unallocated.

* To satisfy allocations of sizes smaller than a page, the allocator records the
  Page Frame Number (PFN) - the index of the page, and an offset within that
  page, so subsequent small allocations can be merged together and stored on the
  same page.

* The reason this allocator is not just used as the allocator overall is that,
  despite it not suffering too badly from fragmentation, memory often has to be
  linearly searched to satisfy an allocation. Since bitmaps are being examined,
  the search is expensive and this is made worse by the fact that this algorithm
  tends to leave many small free blocks at the beginning of physical memory
  which are scanned for large allocations, which is very wasteful.

* There are two distinct APIs for the allocator - one for UMA architectures, and
  another for NUMA architectures. The principle difference is that the NUMA API
  requires specification of the node affected by the operation.

* Let's examine the API:

1. [init_bootmem()][init_bootmem] - Initialises the memory between 0 and the
   specified PFN `page` - the beginning of usable memory is at the specified PFN
   `start`. [init_bootmem_node()][init_bootmem_node] is the NUMA equivalent.

2. [reserve_bootmem()][reserve_bootmem] - Marks the pages in the specified range
   reserved. Requests to partially reserve a page will result in the full page
   being reserved. [reserve_bootmem_node()][reserve_bootmem_node] is the NUMA
   equivalent.

3. [free_bootmem()][free_bootmem] - Marks the pages in the specified range
   free. [free_bootmem_node()][free_bootmem_node] is the NUMA equivalent.

4. [alloc_bootmem()][alloc_bootmem] - Allocates specified `size` bytes from
   `ZONE_NORMAL`. The allocation will be aligned to the L1 hardware cache for
   efficiency. [alloc_bootmem_node()][alloc_bootmem_node] is the NUMA
   equivalent. [alloc_bootmem_pages_node()][alloc_bootmem_pages_node] is the
   NUMA equivalent.

5. [alloc_bootmem_low()][alloc_bootmem_low] - Allocates specified `size` bytes
   from `ZONE_DMA`. As with `alloc_bootmem()`, the allocation will be
   L1-aligned. [alloc_bootmem_low_pages_node()][alloc_bootmem_low_pages_node] is
   the NUMA equivalent.

6. [alloc_bootmem_pages()][alloc_bootmem_pages] - Allocates specified `size`
   bytes from `ZONE_NORMAL`, aligned on page size so that full pages will be
   returned to the caller.

7. [alloc_bootmem_low_pages()][alloc_bootmem_low_pages] - Same as
   `alloc_bootmem_pages()` only from `ZONE_DMA`.

8. [bootmem_bootmap_pages()][bootmem_bootmap_pages] - Calculates the number of
   pages required to store a bitmap representing the allocation state of the
   specified `pages` number of pages.

9. [free_all_bootmem()][free_all_bootmem] - Used at the end of the useful life
   of the boot allocator - cycles through all pages in the bitmap. For each that
   is free its flags are cleared and the page is freed to the physical page
   allocator (see chapter 6) so the runtime allocator can set up its free
   lists. [free_all_bootmem_node()][free_all_bootmem_node] is the NUMA
   equivalent.

## 5.1 Representing the Boot Map

* [struct bootmem_data][bootmem_data], typedef-d to `bootmem_data_t`, exists for
  each NUMA node of memory in the system. It contains information needed for the
  boot memory allocator to allocate memory for a node - the bitmap representing
  allocated pages and where the memory is located:

```c
/*
 * node_bootmem_map is a map pointer - the bits represent all physical
 * memory pages (including holes) on the node.
 */
typedef struct bootmem_data {
        unsigned long node_boot_start;
        unsigned long node_low_pfn;
        void *node_bootmem_map;
        unsigned long last_offset;
        unsigned long last_pos;
} bootmem_data_t;
```

* Looking at each field:

1. `node_boot_start` - The starting _physical_ address of the represented block.
2. `node_low_pfn` - The end physical address of the block (LS - likely exclusive
   bound), in other words the end of the `ZONE_NORMAL` this node represents.
3. `node_bootmem_map` - The _virtual_ address of the bitmap representing
   allocated or free pages with each bit.
4. `last_offset` - The offset within the page of the end of the last
   allocation. If 0, the page is full.
5. `last_pos` - The PFN of the page used with the last allocation. Combined with
   `last_offset` a test can be made to see if allocations can be merged into the
   last page rather than needing to allocate a whole new page.

## 5.2 Initialising the Boot Memory Allocator

* Each architecture is required to supply a [setup_arch()][setup_arch] function
  which, among other tasks, is responsible for determining the necessary
  parameters to initialise the boot memory allocator.

* Each architecture additionally has its own function to get the necessary
  parameters. On i386, this is achieved via [setup_memory()][setup_memory] (as
  discussed in 2.2.2.)

* `setup_memory()` calculates the following parameters:

1. `min_low_pfn` - The lowest PFN available in the system.

2. `max_low_pfn` - The highest PFN that may be addressed by low memory
   (`ZONE_NORMAL`.)

3. `highstart_pfn` - This is the PFN of the beginning of high memory
   (`ZONE_HIGHMEM`.)

4. `highend_pfn` - This is the last PFN in high memory.

5. `max_pfn` - This is the last PFN available to the system.

## 5.3 Initialising bootmem_data

* After the limits of usable physical memory are discovered by
  [setup_memory()][setup_memory], one of two boot memory initialisation
  functions is selected and provided with the start and end PFN for the node to
  be initialised.

* [init_bootmem()][init_bootmem], which initialises
  [contig_page_data][contig_page_data], is used by UMA architectures, whereas
  [init_bootmem_node()][init_bootmem_node] is used by NUMA systems to initialise
  a specified node. Both functions are trivial and rely on
  [init_bootmem_core()][init_bootmem_core] to do the real work.

* `init_bootmem_core()` does the following:

1. Inserts the node's [pg_data_t][pg_data_t] into [pgdat_list][pgdat_list] - at
   the end of this function this node is ready for use and needs to be
   established.

2. Records the starting and end address this node in its associated
   [bootmem_data_t][bootmem_data] structure.

3.  Allocates the bitmap representing page allocations. The size (in bytes,
    hence the division by 8) of the bitmap required is calculated as `mapsize =
    (end_pfn - start_pfn + 7)/8`.

4. The bitmap is stored at the _physical_ address pointed to by
   `bootmem_data_t->node_boot_start`, and the _virtual_ address to this map is
   placed in `bootmem_data_t->node_bootmem_map`.

5. Initialises the entire bitmap to 1, effectively marking all pages allocated,
   so in the next step it can determine available memory and mark them
   unallocated hence available.

6. On i386, [register_bootmem_low_pages()][register_bootmem_low_pages] is used
   to read through the [e820 map][e820], calling [free_bootmem()][free_bootmem]
   for each usable page to set the bit 0 (marking it available for allocation),
   before calling [reserve_bootmem()][reserve_bootmem] to reserve the pages
   needed by the actual bitmap itself.

## 5.4 Allocating Memory

* The [reserve_bootmem()][reserve_bootmem] function may be used to reserve pages
  for use by the caller, but is very cumbersome to use for general allocations.

* As discussed previously, there are a number of functions for allocating memory
  in both UMA and NUMA systems - [alloc_bootmem()][alloc_bootmem],
  [alloc_bootmem_low()][alloc_bootmem_low],
  [alloc_bootmem_pages()][alloc_bootmem_pages] and
  [alloc_bootmem_low_pages()][alloc_bootmem_low_pages] for UMA, and
  [alloc_bootmem_node()][alloc_bootmem_node],
  [alloc_bootmem_pages_node()][alloc_bootmem_pages_node], and
  [alloc_bootmem_low_pages_node()][alloc_bootmem_low_pages_node] for NUMA
  systems.

* All of these call [__alloc_bootmem()][__alloc_bootmem] or
  [__alloc_bootmem_node()][__alloc_bootmem_node] with different parameters:

1. (NUMA-only) `pgdat` - The node to allocate from. In the UMA case it is
   assumed to be [contig_page_data][contig_page_data].

2. `size` - The size in bytes of the requested allocation.

3. `align` - The number of bytes the request should be aligned to. For small
   allocations, they are aligned to `SMP_CACHE_BYTES` which on i386 will align
   to the L1 hardware cache.

4. `goal` - The preferred starting physical address to begin allocating
   from. The `_low` functions will start from physical address `0`, whereas the
   others will begin from [MAX_DMA_ADDRESS][MAX_DMA_ADDRESS] - the maximum
   address DMA transfers may be made from on the architecture.

* The core function for all the allocation APIs is
  [__alloc_bootmem_core()][__alloc_bootmem_core]. This performs the following
  tasks:

1. Linearly scan memory starting from `goal` for a block of memory large enough
   to satisfy the allocation.

2. Decides whether or not the new allocation can be merged with the previous
   one. A merge will be performed if the page for the previous allocation
   (`bootmem_data->pos`) is adjacent to the page found for this allocation, the
   previous page has some free space in it (`bootmem_data->offset != 0`), and
   the alignment is less than `PAGE_SIZE`.

3. Updates `pos` and `offset` fields to store the last page used for allocating
   and how much of the last page was used. If the page was fully used, offset
   will be set to `0`.

## 5.5 Freeing Memory

* Freeing is performed via either [free_bootmem()][free_bootmem] or
  [free_bootmem_node()][free_bootmem_node] for UMA and NUMA systems
  respectively.

* Both functions ultimately call [free_bootmem_core()][free_bootmem_core],
  `free_bootmem()` passes [contig_page_data][contig_page_data]`.bdata` and
  `free_bootmem_node()` passes the appropriate `pgdat->bdata`.

* `free_bootmem_core()` is relatively simple compared to other allocator
  functions. For each _full_ page affected by the free, the corresponding bit in
  the bitmap is set to 0, with double-frees highlighted via [BUG()][BUG].

* An important restriction of the free functions is that they may only be used
  for freeing _full_ pages. The code rounds down bitmap indexes to an integer
  value, meaning that the page containing the remaining portion of memory is
  left marked as allocated and thus is considered reserved.

* This ultimately doesn't turn out to be a huge problem as the allocations
  persist for the lifetime of the system, however it's an important restriction
  be aware of during boot time.

## 5.6 retiring the Boot Memory Allocator

* Late in the bootstrapping process, the function [start_kernel()][start_kernel]
  is called, which knows it is safe to remove the boot allocator and its
  associated data structures.

* Each architecture is required to provide a [mem_init()][mem_init] function
  that is responsible for:

1.  destroying the boot memory allocator and its associated structures.

2. Calculating the dimensions of low and high memory and outputting a message to
   a user describing these.

3. Providing final initialisations of hardware if necessary.

* For i386, the pertinent function here is [free_pages_init()][free_pages_init].

* `free_pages_init()` first tells the boot memory allocator to retire itself by
  calling [free_all_bootmem()][free_all_bootmem] for UMA systems or
  [free_all_bootmem_node()][free_all_bootmem_node] for NUMA systems.

* Both call [free_all_bootmem_core()][free_all_bootmem_core].

* For all unallocated pages known to the allocator for the node it:

1. Clears the `PG_reserved` flag in its [struct page][page].

2. Sets the `page->count` field to 1.

3. Calls [__free_pages()][__free_pages] so the buddy allocator (discussed in
   chapter 6) call build its free liss.

* Next, it frees all pages used for the bitmap and gives them to the buddy
  allocator.

* At this stage, the buddy allocator has control of all the pages in low memory,
  leaving only the high memory pages left to deal with.

* After [free_all_bootmem()][free_all_bootmem] returns,
  [free_pages_init()][free_pages_init] counts the number of reserved pages for
  accounting purposes.

* After this, `free_pages_init()` calls
  [one_highpage_init()][one_highpage_init] for every page between
  [highstart_pfn][highstart_pfn] and [highend_pfn][highend_pfn].

* `one_highpage_init()` does the same as `free_all_bootmem_core()` did for the
  low memory - clears the `PG_reserved` flag, sets the count to 1 and calls
  `__free_pages()` to hand them over to the buddy allocator.

* At this point, the boot memory allocator is no longer required and the buddy
  allocator is the main physical page allocator for the system.

* An interesting point to note is that not only is the data used for
  bootstrapping removed, so is the _code_. All initialisation functions that are
  required only during system startup are marked [__init][__init], e.g.
  `unsigned long __init free_all_bootmem(void);`

* All (non-module) uses of `__init` cause the functions specified this way to
  be placed together in the `.init` section of the kernel binary (typically
  [vmlinux][vmlinux] is an ELF format binary), and (on i386)
  [free_initmem()][free_initmem] walks all the pages from
  [__init_begin][__init_begin] to [__init_end][__init_end], potentially freeing
  a significant amount of RAM.

* The following flowchart describes how the global [mem_map][mem_map] array is
  allocated and initialised, and how the pages are given to the main allocator:
