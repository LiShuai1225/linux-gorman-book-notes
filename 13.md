# Chapter 13: Out of Memory Management

* The Out-of-Memory (OOM) manager is pretty straightforward as it has one simple
  task: check if there is enough memory to satisfy requests, if not verify the
  system is truly out of memory and if so, select a process to kill.

* The OOM killer is a controversial part of the VM and there has been much
  discussion about removing it but yet it remains.
