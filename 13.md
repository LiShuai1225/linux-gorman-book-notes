# Chapter 13: Out of Memory Management

* The Out-of-Memory (OOM) manager is pretty straightforward as it has one simple
  task: check if there is enough memory to satisfy requests, if not verify the
  system is truly out of memory and if so, select a process to kill.

* The OOM killer is a controversial part of the VM and there has been much
  discussion about removing it but yet it remains.

## 13.1 Checking Available Memory

* For certain operations such as expanding the heap with [brk()][brk] or
  remapping an address space with [mremap()][mremap], the system will check if
  there is enough available memory to satisfy a request. Note that this is
  separate from the [out_of_memory()][out_of_memory] path that is covered in the
  next section, rather it is an attempt to _avoid_ the system being in a state
  of OOM if at all possible.

* When checking available memory, the number of requested pages is passed as a
  parameter to [vm_enough_memory()][vm_enough_memory]. Unless the sysadmin has
  specified that the system should overcommit memory, the amount of memory will
  be checked.

* To determine how many pages are potentially available, linux sums up the following:

1. __Total page cache__ - Easily reclaimed.

2. __Total free pages__ - They are already available.

3. __Total free swap pages__ - Because userspace processes may be paged out.

4. __Total pages managed by [swapper_space][swapper_space]__ - This
   double-counts free swap pages, but is somewhat mitigated by the fact that
   slots are sometimes reserved but not used.

5. __Total pages used by the [struct dentry][dentry] cache__ - Easily reclaimed.

6. __Total pages used by the [struct inode][inode] cache__ - Easily reclaimed.

* If the total number of pages added here is sufficient for the request,
  [vm_enough_memory()][vm_enough_memory] returns true otherwise it returns false
  and `-ENOMEM` is returned to userspace.
