# Chapter 13: Out of Memory Management

* The Out-of-Memory (OOM) manager is pretty straightforward as it has one simple
  task: check if there is enough memory to satisfy requests, if not verify the
  system is truly out of memory and if so, select a process to kill.

* The OOM killer is a controversial part of the VM and there has been much
  discussion about removing it but yet it remains.

## 13.1 Checking Available Memory

* For certain operations such as expanding the heap with [brk()][brk] or
  remapping an address space with [mremap()][mremap], the system will check if
  there is enough available memory to satisfy a request. Note that this is
  separate from the [out_of_memory()][out_of_memory] path that is covered in the
  next section, rather it is an attempt to _avoid_ the system being in a state
  of OOM if at all possible.

* When checking available memory, the number of requested pages is passed as a
  parameter to [vm_enough_memory()][vm_enough_memory]. Unless the sysadmin has
  specified that the system should overcommit memory, the amount of memory will
  be checked.

* To determine how many pages are potentially available, linux sums up the following:

1. __Total page cache__ - Easily reclaimed.

2. __Total free pages__ - They are already available.

3. __Total free swap pages__ - Because userspace processes may be paged out.

4. __Total pages managed by [swapper_space][swapper_space]__ - This
   double-counts free swap pages, but is somewhat mitigated by the fact that
   slots are sometimes reserved but not used.

5. __Total pages used by the [struct dentry][dentry] cache__ - Easily reclaimed.

6. __Total pages used by the [struct inode][inode] cache__ - Easily reclaimed.

* If the total number of pages added here is sufficient for the request,
  [vm_enough_memory()][vm_enough_memory] returns true otherwise it returns false
  and `-ENOMEM` is returned to userspace.

## 13.2 Determining OOM Status

* When the machine is low on memory, old page frames wil be reclaimed (see
  chapter 10) but, despite reclaiming pages, it may find it was unable to free
  enough to satisfy a request even when scanning at highest priority.

* If the system does fail to free page frames, [out_of_memory()][out_of_memory]
  is called to see if the system is _actually_ out of memory and if it is, kills
  a process:

```c
/**
 * out_of_memory - is the system out of memory?
 */
void out_of_memory(void)
{
        static unsigned long first, last, count, lastkill;
        unsigned long now, since;

        /*
         * Enough swap space left?  Not OOM.
         */
        if (nr_swap_pages > 0)
                return;

        now = jiffies;
        since = now - last;
        last = now;

        /*
         * If it's been a long time since last failure,
         * we're not oom.
         */
        last = now;
        if (since > 5*HZ)
                goto reset;

        /*
         * If we haven't tried for at least one second,
         * we're not really oom.
         */
        since = now - first;
        if (since < HZ)
                return;

        /*
         * If we have gotten only a few failures,
         * we're not really oom.
         */
        if (++count < 10)
                return;

        /*
         * If we just killed a process, wait a while
         * to give that task a chance to exit. This
         * avoids killing multiple processes needlessly.
         */
        since = now - lastkill;
        if (since < HZ*5)
                return;

        /*
         * Ok, really out of memory. Kill something.
         */
        lastkill = now;
        oom_kill();

reset:
        first = now;
        count = 0;
}
```

* The reason there are a series of checks here to see whether the system is out
  of memory is that the system may just be waiting for I/O to complete or pages
  to be swapped out to backing storage or some other similar condition - given
  this, we want to avoid killing a process as much as we can which is why there
  are checks in the first instance.
